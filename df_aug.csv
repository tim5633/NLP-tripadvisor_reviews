0,0.0,"Twilight. What can I say about Twilight? I'll begin on a positive note. The film used a good song, Supermassive Black Hole made famous by Muse.Twilight is what can only be described as a mess. It tells the story of 17 year old Bella Swan, a teen who recently went to live with her father in the rainy city of Forks, Washington. There she meets Edward Cullen, an unbearably beautiful vampire. The two fall for each other, but that's not the only force of attraction between them. Edward thirsts for Bella's blood more than any other human's, which makes him especially dangerous to Bella. Lucky for Bella, the Cullens don't drink human blood, and Edward is strong-willed, as well as deeply in love with her. Along with this obsticale in the way of their love, a vampire named James wants her blood-and he won't give up.I must say, I am a fan of the books so this review is a tad biased. This Bella, played by Kristen Stewart, was not the Bella I know. The Bella I know is shy and not sure of herself. This Bella was too confident and sometimes came off as almost rude. Also, the Edward in the film, played by Robert Pattinson, was not a perfect embodiment of the character. This Edward did things that the book character would never have done.On a non-biased note, the film went much too fast. Twilight seemed rushed, and the scenes changed too quickly. There were also scenes that just had me laughing, although they were not meant to be humorous; a couple scenes were just altogether unnecessary.Overall, the movie was a poor interpretation of the book I love so dearly and just a poor film in general.","['""twilight"" tells the story of a teen who meets an unbearably beautiful vampire. the film went much too fast, and the scenes changed too quickly.

35,0.0,"I was just watching a GoodBadFlicks video yesterday where the guy was laughing at US movie studios for buying film rights for some stories and foreign films that they could never ever present in the US for fear of protests. For me it was a strange proposal, why wouldn't they be able to show something raw, uncensored, original? The answer was obvious, but I am not going to dwell on that point.La Planete Sauvage is probably a movie in this category. The film is short, just over an hour, but from the very beginning it starts with something controversial: a woman carrying a baby is being teased by giant humanoids that have fingers the size of the woman. It turns out they are children, playing with the human as a human would play with an ant. They accidentally kill her and her baby is being taken as a pet by one of these giants. They are called Tragg and they consider humans animals, to be petted or exterminated as they please. The very first scenes are brutal to watch and that's why I think this would never sit well with a culture that values superiority more than anything else.You have to watch it in French, if you get the language, I had a dual French/English audio film with English subtitles and, even if I didn't go through the English audio, there is something about the French language that just naturally blends with the arrogant culture of the Traggs. The Tragg culture and their planet were truly spectacular. To think that in 1973 someone thought of a superior technological culture that is truly alien while remaining humanoid, and did it well, was amazing. The concepts hold true even now, in 2014!I have to say that I have been thinking of writing a story about humans treated as pets by an alien culture, but after I've seen this I couldn't possibly do it, as it is perfect as storyline and concepts. It also makes me think of another subject close to my heart: dogs. In Romania there are still a lot of vagabond dogs and the heartless and pointless discussions about exterminating them are very close to what the Tragg are doing when considering the human vermin. There are also some ideas about the \""wild human\"" society that hit close to this concept of groups of people gathering around the mentality of the lowest common denominator. So, in my mind, to add valid philosophical and moral points to an already brilliant story with fantastic drawings is like covering the icing of the cake with a ton of cherries!About the animation style. This is something that made some people rate this film a lot lower than it deserves. Are you aware that it was made in 1973, by Czech animators? Actually, besides the voice actors and the wonderful director Ren\u00e9 Laloux, there were almost no French people in the production team. The animation in the Czech Republic is a reason for national pride, but the way they do it was unique and certainly different from the US, French and Japanese animation styles. OK, so maybe you prefer the animation style of Robin Hood, with the animals, but really, this is so much better in so many ways that I couldn't possibly get snagged on animation.Bottom line: The imagination, the way it just threw out there idea after idea, no matter how uncomfortable, the storyline, the amazing creatures, the weird ways in which they were killing people... it was true sci-fi. The real thing! Watch this! It will take an hour of your life, big deal! You will see that your brain will churn all of those ideas for a while after watching the film. It will feel like a strange but amazing flavor on your tongue.

61,0.0,"The historical drama 'Denial' by Mick Jackson thematizes the post- truth world by focusing on the topic of Holocaust denialism and the lawsuit of David Irving against historian Deborah Lipstadt.Referring to the Leuchter report, historic writer and self-appointed historian Irving claims that the Holocaust never existed and even accuses survivors of it as frauds. Historian Lipstadt publishes a book in which she stands up against these lies, but Irving fights back in form of a lawsuit, since his reputation is now ruined. A few years later, Lipstadt and her lawyers must prove that she is in the right and that the Nazi regime's crimes against humanity happened.This film really has the finger on the pulse: It conveys a topical message to the audiences and raises significant questions how far the freedom of speech goes. By exposing the tactics of Mr. Irving, it draws a parallel to today's alt-right movement and how they create their own alternative version of the world (and of history). Even here on IMDb are people who defend Irving (actually, quite alarmingly lot), although he is a Hitler apologist, an open racist and denies the crimes against humanity the national socialists committed. As Lipstadt expounds, denying the Holocaust and being pro-Nazism is against the basic principles of modern societies. Thus, no one can call the film ''biased'', as there is just one acceptable opinion! - but that's another point and maybe this is not the best place here to discuss it. The film talks about this, especially in the end, highlighted by a strong, terrific statement by Lipstadt. Moreover, there are two brilliant scenes where barrister Richard Rampton, played by Tom Wilkinson, undertakes a frontal attack against Irving and unmasks his lying strategy. Applause, applause!The second big plus of the film is its accurate authenticity conveyed by the actors \u2013 ALL of them are glorious in their roles. My big respect goes to Timothy Spall who interprets the disgusting character of Irving in a chilling way. Rachel Weisz really shows how important the history for Deborah Lipstadt is and gives her a heroic warmth, but also a sentimental side. All the humanity which is missing in Irving can be found in her. Tom Wilkinson and Andrew Scott portray the lawyers Rampton and Julius who focus on the facts and figures much to the dismay of Lipstadt. But both get some human scenes as well and it is more than pleasant to see the showdown between Rampton and Irving where he finally looks this man in the eyes and takes him down. Again applause! Some conflicts appear between Lipstadt and her lawyers, but sadly they are only adumbrated: Julius has obviously some other motives than justice and Deborah has a rumpus with him over the question whether the Holocaust survivors should testify or not. Ultimately, this is never played out fully, but is compensated by the authentic performances of the main actors.Sounds like a food-for-thought-drama to watch, nevertheless its IMDb ratings are not always so rosy (even by people who are not Irving fans, I suppose :)). Why so? The biggest problem of the film, beside its uninspirational and easy forgettable score is that the main enemy, Mr. Irving, is very soon forced onto the defensive. There are some scenes where he tries to manipulate and win over the judge and the public, but there is no offensive counter strike against Lipstadt, not a gripping confrontation. I do not think that this makes the film boring, no, the 109 minutes pass by quickly, but on the contrary, it also eliminates any surprises concerning the dramaturgy of the storyline. Thanks to several questions \u2013 How can something which definitely happened be proved in court? What is the price of fighting for the truth?... \u2013 and thanks to the extreme degree of topicality, an interested viewer will keep watching. This validates that the film makes something right. Nonetheless, the criticism that 'Denial' feels in part generic, because of its lack of originality and suspense may not seem too far- fetched. For example: the scenes in the court, which use the real dialogue of the trial, give the film a documental touch, but may seem a bit low- paced to some.Overall, the message and topic of 'Denial' is so pertinent for the current condition the discussion culture in democracies finds itself. This film can bolster all who fear that far-right politicians like Marine Le Pen or Donald Trump can skew the history with their alternative facts. Instead, the story of David Irving's downfall proves that truth will always win. Without a shadow of a doubt, the film has a noble ambition and a significant message, but in a cinematic sense, Denial is not a perfect film \u2013 I really don't know who to blame for the genericism. More depth and less generic courtroom discussions and lawyer meetings would have been appropriate. Not only the audiences but the topic deserves it.Generous 8 pts.","[""'Denial' is a historical drama that thematizes the post- truth world by focusing on the topic of Holocaust denialism and the lawsuit of historian Deborah Lipstadt. by exposing the tactics of David Irving, it draws a parallel to today's alt-right movement and how they create their own alternative version of the world. the biggest problem of the film, aside from its uninspirational and easy forgettable score, is that the main enemy, Mr.""]","[""the historical drama'denial'by mick jackson thematizes the post - truth world by focusing on the topic of holocaust denialism and the lawsuit of david irving against historian deborah lipstadt. referring to the leuchter report, historic writer the self - appointed historian irving claims that the holocaust never existed and even accuses survivors of it as frauds. historian lipstadt publishes a novel in which she stands up against these lies, but irving fights back in form of a lawsuit, since his reputation is now ruined. a few years later, lipstadt and her lawyers must prove that she is in the right and that the nazi regime's crimes against humanity happened. this film really has the finger on the pulse : it conveys a topical message to the audiences and raises significant questions how far the freedom of speech goes. by exposing the tactics by mr. dan irving, it draws a parallel to today's alt - right movement and how they create their own alternative version of the world ( and of history ). even here on imdb are people who defend irving ( actually, quite alarmingly lot ), although helium is a hitler apologist, an open racist and denies the crimes against humanity the national socialists committed. as lipstadt expounds, deny the holocaust and being righteous. thus, no one can call the film'' biased'', as there is just one acceptable opinion! - but that's another point and maybe this is not the best place here to discuss it. the film talks about this, especially in the end, emphasized by a strong, terrific statement by lipstadt. moreover, there are two awkward scenes where barrister richard rampton, played by tom wilkinson, undertakes a frontal attack against irving and unmasks his lying strategy. applause, applause! the second big plus of the film is its accurate authenticity conveyed by the actors \\ u2013 all of them are glorious in their roles. my big respect kick the bucket to timothy spall who interprets the disgusting character of irving in a chilling way. rachel weisz really shows how important the history for deborah lipstadt is and gives her a heroic warmth, but also a sentimental side. all the humanity which is missing in irving can be found in her. tom wilkinson and andrew scott portray the lawyers rampton and julius who focus on the facts and figure much to the dismay of lipstadt. but both get some human scenes out well and it is more immediately pleasant to see the showdown against rampton and irving where he finally looks this man in the eyes and takes him down. again applause! some conflicts appear between lipstadt and her lawyers, but sadly they are only adumbrated : julius has obviously some other motives than justice and deborah has a rumpus with him over the question whether the holocaust survivors should testify or not. ultimately, this is never played out fully, but is compensated by the authentic performances of the chief actors. sounds like a food for thought - for - thought - drama to watch, nevertheless its imdb ratings are not always so rosy ( even by people who are not irving fans, i suppose : ) ). why so?

63,0.0,"I did not watch this in 3D.Before I begin with \""CoCo\"", I would like to state that the Frozen featurette before the film, not in 3D, was extremely boring and the Frozen shorts are becoming increasingly worn-out. Olaf is not funny and the jokes quickly get old after the first one. When he got lost, I thought, great he's gone, we can move on. When I found out the family tradition was Olaf, that was the \""perfect\"" cap to an annoying featurette. In Mexico, people were so annoyed by it that they completely took it away and are not making viewers watch it at all. We are not so lucky.First off, I will state that I do speak Spanish and have a high respect for the cultural traditions represented in this movie. I love how Disney is highlighting a variety of cultures and making a sincere attempt to creating high-quality movies that showcase aspects from these cultures.I love all the cultural elements of this movie. Others tend to pick apart every minor flaw or even a perceived misunderstanding of a cultural element to enhance the entertainment value. This movie made me want to go home and look up the history of \""Dia de Muertos\"" to compare it to details I saw in the movie.All 5 of my points go to highlighting these aspects of Mexican culture and also to the last 30 minutes of the movie, which was actually entertaining.The boring featurette was actually the beginning of a mostly boring movie. Typically I will not laugh at all Disney jokes, but usually there are a few that have me chuckling. This had none, not one. There were a few mediocre attempts at humor that I can count on one hand, but none were actually funny. I heard one or two strained laughs in the whole theater at each decent joke. It was a total of maybe 5-6 laughs the whole movie out of 100 viewers.The beginning 30-45 minutes was meant to highlight Mexican family culture, but was extremely boring. I had thoughts of walking out at the 30 minute mark. It was almost painfully boring. At that point, I was embarrassed to have bought a ticket to watch \""Coco.\"" The main storyline is that a distant relative(great, great grandfather I believe) of Miguel was a musician and walked out on the family. The great, great grandmother banished all music from the home at that point and based the family around making shoes. There are roughly 30 minutes dedicated to hitting home this point over and over again. The remainder of the of the movie is loosely based on the fact that Miguel's family hates music. However, Miguel wants to be a musician. In the end, he becomes a musician. The End.There were a couple of things that left me scratching my head that just didn't make sense. The main one was how Miguel made it to the Land of the Dead. He strummed a guitar and instantly became a \""ghost\"". I never understood why this happened and no explanation was offered at any point. This sets up the remainder of the movie with Miguel trying to get back to the world of the living, so it would seem somewhat important to offer some explanation why strumming the guitar would make him enter the Land of the Dead. However, he doesn't become completely dead. Only the dead \""skeletons\"" can see or talk to him. Regular humans can't. But he still remains in his normal living body. However, he is slowly becoming a skeleton and will be completely a skeleton by morning. He can only get back by a family member's blessing. But if they send you back, they can also give you other conditions, such as never playing music again. If you break those conditions, you are instantly sent back to the Land of the Dead. There is no explanation where any of this came from.At this point, I'm questioning why I should care about any of this. The saving character to the film is Hector. After seeing Hector in action with Miguel, you actually start to care about his character. This really is the only reason to care about anything that is going on in the movie. When you see that Hector is about to vanish even from the Land of the Dead, it really hooks you in and you want Miguel to make it back. Before this, I didn't care about any of it really. However, does a good last 30 minutes make up for the remainder of the film? I'm not sure.

64,0.0,"If you're reading these user reviews for MATRIARCH to help you decide whether or not to watch it, make a point of looking at the background of the reviewers. There seems to be lots of one-review-wonder shills trying to put their thumb on the scale with this movie. Never a good sign.The plot line for MATRIARCH is the old \""innocent and na\u00efve people who are touring the countryside have car trouble and seek aid from remote country folk who turn out to be diabolical predators\"". In this case, the innocent and na\u00efve people are a young couple, and the wife of the couple is VERY pregnant. They have a minor car accident and their car is disabled. Seeking help in a nearby farm, they at first receive a cold and openly hostile welcome until the lord of the farm realizes \""they\"" are pregnant, at which point the welcome becomes very warm indeed. The farm turns out to be populated by the evil version of Ma and Pa Kettle, their two creepy-looking adult sons, and their apparently mute and mysterious young daughter.But it VERY soon develops that the evil elderly farmers wish to separate the baby from the young couple and keep it for their own, which, as it devolves, is also how they acquired their mute daughter and two creepy sons. The contribution of the young couple to the farm is apparently as fertilizer.The balance of MATRIARCH depicts the \""spirited\"" and uncooperative resistance of the young couple to the notion of giving up their baby and assuming room temperature.While MATRIARCH was never going to be a stellar example of the filmmaker's art, it could have at least achieved a rating of \""satisfactory\"" rather than \""please make it stop\"" if only the storyline hadn't been so execrable. The acting was not inspired but neither were the roles being portrayed; the acting was lower-adequate to purpose and was at least not stony faced and clumsy which is the usual fare for such movies. There were too many unjustified close-ups to be sure, but at least they were not utterly incessant as with most beginning directors of photography.In other words, for what it is, I COULD have been saying things like \""surprisingly good for such a cheap and cheesy picture\"".Unfortunately, while so many aspects of the film were grimly fighting to stay airborne, the writing was so bad that it drove the whole mess into the ground in a giant slimy ball of artless misery. While it's true that the young couple had been captured by a monstrous family grimly determined to do them ill, the reason the young couple REMAINED captives was because they stupidly and emotionally went out of their way to literally throw away every opportunity they had of saving themselves. To wit:Relatively early on in the film, the wife, shackled to a bed and awaiting giving birth, manages to free herself from her shackles and arms herself with a large heavy cross. When given the opportunity to brain Ma Kettle with it, she instead goes pity pat with it on Ma's head leaving Ma entirely uninjured who brings the entire family down upon said wife. Derp.Then later, the husband manages to escape being buried alive and naked and return across miles of countryside to the evil farm, successfully dispatch the two creepy sons right before they rape his wife, and then, instead of quietly leveraging his wife out of her shackles with the giant prybar he has found, the husband precedes to loudly bang away on the shackles and then stand around and discuss the finer points of escape with his wife. This, of course, gives the farmer and his wife, who have not failed to hear the loud banging of the shackles as it echoed around the farmhouse, to react to the attempted escape. Mr. farmer retrieves his shotgun and, when the young couple have finally finished their academic debate and have leisurely slouched their way out the door of the prison barn, Mr. farmer, unsurprisingly resentful at their attempted escape, blows the young husband's insides outside.Near the end of the movie the wife has a double barrel shotgun and a clean shot at Ma Kettle standing perhaps 12 yards in front of her. One shot barely touches Ma and the other misses her entirely. Yep. She manages to miss at nearly point-blank range with a shotgun. What the hell was she aiming at?And these are but a few examples. Remembering that the young couple is supposedly fighting for their lives and the life of their baby, the literary vehicle driving the movie forward is their complete ineffectiveness in everything having to do with escape. And as usually happens in such cases, by the end of the picture you find yourself rooting for the evil farmers. You become convinced that if the young couple were to keep their baby, they're so flipping stupid it would be dead in a week. Best to leave it with the evil farmers. You know, for the baby's sake. Sheesh.I have only one good thing to say about MATRIARCH. There is a ghost introduced into the movie and that aspect of the movie is executed fairly well. Admittedly, watching MATRIARCH did lower my IQ by 75% so my complement on this point may be misplaced, but I was mildly surprised by it at the end. The methodology of its introduction and depiction are as old and hackneyed as the rest of the movie, but at least it was accomplished reasonably well.","['the plot line for MATRIARCH is the old ""innocent and nau00efve people"" the writing was so bad that it drove the whole mess into the ground. a ghost introduced into the movie is executed fairly well.']","['if you\'re reading these user reviews for matriarch to help you decide whether or not to watch it, make a point of looking at the background of the reviewers. there seems to be lots of one - review - wonder shills trying to put their thumb on the scale with this movie. never a good sign. the plot line for matriarch is the old \\ "" innocent and na \\ u00efve people who are touring the countryside have car trouble and seek aid from remote country folk who turn out could be diabolical predators \\ "". throughout this case, the innocent and na \\ u00efve people are a young couple, and the wife of the couple is very pregnant. they have a minor car accident and their car is disabled. seeking help in a nearby farm, they at present receive a cold and openly hostile welcome until the lord of the farm realizes \\ "" they \\ "" are pregnant, at which point the welcome becomes very warm indeed. the trailer turns out to be populated by the evil version of ma and pa kettle, their two creepy - looking adult sons, and their apparently mute and mysterious young daughter. but it very soon develops that the evil elderly farmers wish to separate the baby from the young couple and keep it for their own, which, as it devolves, is also how they acquired their mute daughter and two creepy sons. the contribution of the young couple to the farm is apparently as fertilizer. the balance of matriarch depicts is \\ "" spirited \\ "" and uncooperative resistance of the young couple to the notion of giving her their baby and assuming room temperature. while matriarch was never going to be a stellar example of the filmmaker\'s art, it could have at least achieved a rating of \\ "" satisfactory \\ "" rather than \\ "" please make it stop \\ "" if only the storyline hadn\'t been so execrable. the acting was not inspired but neither were the roles being portrayed ; the acting was lower - adequate to purpose and was at least not stony faced and clumsy which is the usual fare for such movies. there were too many unjustified close - ups to be sure, some at least they were not utterly incessant as with most beginning directors of photography. in other words, for what it is, i could have been saying some like \\ "" surprisingly good for such a cheap and cheesy picture \\ "". unfortunately, while so most aspects of the film show grimly fighting to stay airborne, the writing was so bad that it drove the whole mess into the ground in a giant slimy ball of artless misery. while it\'s true that the young couple have been captured by a monstrous family grimly determined to do them ill, the reason the young couple remained captives was because they stupidly and emotionally went out of their way to literally throw away every opportunity they had of saving themselves. to wit : relatively early on in the film, the wife, shackled to a bed and awaiting giving birth, manages to free herself from her shackles and arms herself with a large heavy cross. when given the opportunity to brain ma kettle with it, she instead goes pity pat with it on ma\'s head leaving ma entirely uninjured who brings the entire family down upon said wife. derp. then after, the husband manages to escape being buried alive and naked and return across miles of countryside to the evil farm, successfully dispatch the two creepy sons right before they rape his wife, and then, instead of quietly leveraging his wife out of her shackles with the giant prybar he has found, the husband precedes to loudly bang away on the shackles and then stand around and discuss the finer points of escape with his wife. this, of course, gives the farmer and his wife, who have not failed to hear the loud banging of the shackles as it echoed around the farmhouse, to react to the attempted escape. mr. farmer retrieves his shotgun and, when the young couple have finally finished their academic debate and have leisurely slouched their way out the door of the prison barn, mr. farmer, unsurprisingly resentful at their attempted escape, blows the young husband\'s insides outside. near the end of the movie the wife has a double barrel shotgun and a clean shot at ma kettle standing perhaps 12 yards in front of her. one shot barely touches ma and the other misses her entirely. yep. she manages to miss at nearly point - blank range with a shotgun. what the hell was she aiming at?

86,0.0,"Let me begin this by saying that when the Twilight book first came out, some of my friends loved it, and I decided to buy and read it for myself. I finished Twilight feeling annoyed, pretty much dragged myself through New Moon, and didn't even try to read Eclipse or Breaking Dawn or whatever night-time-titled monster Meyer is planning to create.Now, one of my friends had an extra ticket to a premiere of Twilight the movie, so I guessed, why not. I might actually like it now that we don't have to hear/read Bella's narration admire Edward's face/eyes/hair/breath/toenails time and time again (little did I know the film would include cheesy voice overs by a monotone Kristen Stewart straight from the novel).To protect myself from the inevitable angry rages of hopelessly devoted Twilight fans, I will begin with the positive comments on this movie.1. Pretty good visuals, nice colors. 2. Great soundtrack/music, especially when Edward plays the piano. 3. The actors playing the Cullens are all enjoyable, and because of their performances I grew pretty fond of the screen versions of Carlisle and Jasper. 4. They did a good job with the baseball game - when I read it in the book I just found it ridiculous.Off to why I really wrote this review- to express my absolute hatred/disgust for the \""acting skills\"" of Kristen Stewart. I don't understand all this raving over her performances, in this movie she was so unemotional and dead I thought she'd already been bitten by a vampire. And its not just the type of mediocre acting you can just brush away - her plain, expressionless face and deadpan voice was almost painful to watch in all of her scenes that were supposed to be dramatic. The only part it seems she put effort in to actually manipulate the muscles in her face or raise her voice was the last hospital scene, and even that didn't impress me that much. Yes, she did her job and screamed and writhed after James' bite, but couldn't I at least see those angry eyebrows tilt a little? Actually move? No Oscar for this one, folks.The movie does its job to faithful novel fans by including real lines from the book itself and passionate, bubbling chemistry between the main characters Bella and Edward, so that probably made them not pay any attention to its flaws and declare this \""PERFECT!!\"" or \""D BEST MOVIE EVR!!!!!1!11!1\""Now I'm not telling everyone to hate this movie, I mean, if you enjoy it and like watching it, go ahead, I'm not complaining. But do not proclaim Twilight - The Movie as the best-created or best-acted or anything like that, because it's not true. Lastly, do not respond to this review in some irate, screaming, capitalized comment about how I'm stupid or I'm a loser for not liking Twilight, because I'm not even arguing with any fans.","['the movie does its job to faithful novel fans by including real lines from the book itself and passionate, bubbling chemistry between the main characters. the only part it seems she put effort in to actually manipulate the muscles in her face or raise her voice was the last hospital scene.']","['let me begin this by saying that when the twilight book first came out, some of my friends loved it, and i settle to buy and read it for myself. i finished twilight feeling annoyed, too much dragged myself through new moon, and didn\'t even want to take eclipse or breaking dawn or whatever night - time - titled monster meyer is planning to create. now, one of my friends had an extra ticket to a premiere of twilight the movie, so i guessed, why not. i might actually like bella now that we don\'t have to hear / read bella\'s narration admire edward\'s face / eyes / hair / breath / toenails time and prison term again ( little do i know the film would include cheesy voice overs by a monotone kristen stewart straight from the novel ). to protect myself from the inevitable angry rages of hopelessly devoted twilight fans, i will begin with the proper comments on this movie. 1. pretty good visuals, nice colors. 2. great soundtrack / music, especially when edward plays the piano. 3. the actors behind the cullens are all enjoyable, and because of their performances i grew extremely fond to the screen versions of carlisle and jasper. 4. they did a good job with the baseball game - when i read it in the book i just found it ridiculous. off to why i really wrote this review - to express my absolute hatred / disgust for the \\ "" acting skills \\ "" of kristen stewart. i don\'t understand all this raving over her performances, in this movie she was so unemotional and dead i thought she\'d already been bitten by a vampire. and its not just the type of mediocre acting ya can just brush away - her plain, expressionless face and deadpan voice was almost painful to watch in all of her scenes that were supposed to be dramatic. the only part it seems she put effort in to actually manipulate the muscles in her face or raise her voice was the last hospital scene, and even that didn\'t impress me that much. yes, she did her job and screamed and writhed after james\'bite, but couldn\'t i at least see those angry eyebrows tilt a little? actually move? no oscar for this one, folks. no movie does its job to faithful novel fans by including real lines from the book itself and passionate, bubbling chemistry between the main character reference bella and edward, so that probably made them not pay any attention to its flaws and declare this \\ "" perfect!! \\ "" operating room \\ "" d best movie evr!!!!! 1! 11! 1 \\ "" now i\'m not telling everyone to hate this flick, i mean, if you enjoy it and like watching it, go ahead, i\'m not complaining. but don\'t proclaim twilight - the movie as the best - created or best - play or anything like that, because it\'s not true some irate, screaming, capitalized comment about how i\'m stupid or i\'m a loser for not liking twilight, because i\'m not even arguing with any fans.']"

I'm marking it as \""spoiler\"" because it MIGHT contain some small ones, but if you go see this movie, it's already spoiled, rotted, and dessicated without any help from me.This movie stank. It was inept on almost every level. The acting was mediocre at best, the characters were poorly developed, the camera work was painful at times, the effects were laughably bad, the wirework is the worst I've ever seen, and the whole story is so ludicrous that I wanted to rip my hair out.First off, these aren't vampires. Dracula was a vampire. These \""vampires\"" have almost nothing in common aside from drinking blood and being immortal and...wait, that's it. They walk in the daylight (and ooh! They sparkle, because teenie girls love sparkles!), they don't have fangs, they don't sleep in coffins, turn into bats, don't have an aversion to silver or garlic, walk over running water, don't mind crosses...the list goes on. Some of that is forgivable, but all of it? Nope. This is yet another pop-culture pussification of vampires, turning them into something ludicrous and throwing almost all the mythology out the window. Give me a nightwalking, bloodsucking, evil minion of the devil any day of the week. Don't call the Twilight \""vampires\"" by that name because, quite frankly, they're not.Was the director of this movie high the whole time? Did she bother to try directing the actors, much less go over their dialog and realize that no normal human being would talk like that? The culmination of the two would be Bella blubbering in bed at the end for Edward to not leave her. I almost burst out laughing, but by then my soul had been sapped to the point that I thought laughter would be impossible. And I think her only direction for the vampires was, \""Okay, ready, set, ACTION! Okay guys, SMOLDER! SMOLDER! SMOLDER!\"", because that's about the extent of the vampire \""acting\"" in this movie. Lots of smoldering looks and very little else. And couldn't she have made sure the effects weren't awful? Seriously, who could have seen the fast vampire effect and thought it looked better than Scifi channel original movie effects? Did the director blow all the budget on crack to use while she was making this? And what was with the horrid wirework? Seriously. Watch Edward jumping from his window to the tree outside and see how he moves in a perfectly straight line. Watch the bad vampire jump over Bella and watch how his trajectory dips, then arcs UP, then drops in front of her. It's unbelievable. And did anyone else notice how the camera-work in the woods when Bella says she knows that Edward is a vampire was pointless and utterly distracting? Sorry, but that's not a good way to convey what was happening. Try again. Oh, wait, the studio decided you couldn't. Sorry.Why the heck is Edward so dreamy? He's a creepy stalker! He sneaks into Bella's room at night and watches her sleep? Oooh, so romantic! I sneak into a girl's room at night to watch her sleep? Pepper spray, a boot to the balls, and lots of community service. He follows her around wherever she goes? Nah, not stalking at all. He's just enamored with her and it's sooo dreamy! What a hairy load. Setting aside his saving her life twice (a contrivance so they can speed things up and they don't have to make them fall in love the old fashioned way), Edward could do anything to her and it would be so wonderful. I cannot understand that. Maybe that's why so many women will date total jerks and excuse everything they do. It explains a lot, actually.Sorry, but his movie is crap. Those who love it are likely so whipped up into a fervor about the book being turned into a movie that they'd watch anything with Edward in it. It could be Hostel 3: Vampire Style with Edward ripping limbs off of Bella in a bloodbath and it would be wonderful to them.

If you went for the story, Transformer wouldn't be the best choice -- the structure is loose, I don't understand why Mr Voight would choose to be part of this film, the way the film narrative treated the US govermetn is just a satire -- stupid defensive team, listens to a soldier's opinion. It felt like bits and pieces been put together. I suppose its due to the fact that the film's an adaption from the comic strip. And Sam's parents -- why are they there?!

122,0.0,"Greetings again from the darkness. The Bosnian War is not something most Americans know much about. The cursory western media coverage was matched by the hands-off approach from the UN, until the very end. This movie doesn't shy away from exposing the atrocities of ethnic cleansing and genocide that occurred against civilians. The comparisons to Nazi war camps are inescapable.This is no place for a history lesson, and I would certainly not be the one to supply it, but some basics are required to somewhat understand what's going on. The reign of Yugoslavian President Tito lasted until his death in 1980. Although much criticism is directed his way, he was able to maintain a society that allowed the co-existence of Bosniak Muslims and Orthodox Serbs. You might recall that in 1984, Sarajevo hosted the Winter Olympics. Not long after that, the republics began skirmishes that eventually escalated to a complicated civil war lasting from 1992-95 (The Bosnian War).The film makes no attempt to capture the full scope of the war, instead choosing a microscopic approach by focusing on two people. Danijel (Goran Kostic) and Ajla (Zana Marjanovic) are dancing cozily in a club when a bomb shatters their date and their lives. Danijel goes on to become a mid-level military leader of the Serbs, while Ajla and her Muslim family and friends are torn apart, some even executed. Ajla ends up as a prisoner at the camp Danijel commands. He manages to protect her from the brutal rapes by soldiers by staking a claim on her and putting the order out that she is not to be touched.Ajla is an artist and Danijel is a soldier and their earlier dance evolves into a psychological battle of wits, mistrust and escape. Danijel is clearly not of the mindset to be a brutal killer within a war, yet Ajla constantly observes his every movement and even the slightest change in his approach to her and the war. She does what she needs to survive and he uses her as an escape from the atrocities of his day job. The end result of this relationship is both shocking and inevitable.Danijel's father, Nebojsa, is a senior level military leader who shows up in time to provide us with a brief history lesson dating back 600 years. He takes much pride in the Serbs ability to persevere. Nebojsa is played by Rade Serbedzija, whom many will recognize as the villain from The Saint (1997) and Boris the Blade in Snatch (2000). This is a powerful and frightening character, and we quickly understand why he doubts his son's fortitude. When he finds out about Ajla, we immediately know things are going to get ugly.After the screening, we were fortunate enough to have a discussion panel sponsored by the World Affairs Council. One of the panel members was a former officer in the Bosnian Army who spent time in two separate concentration camps. Viewing the film was very emotional for him and he said it captured the realities as well as a movie possibly could. Of course, we never lose sight of the fact that what we see on screen are not \""real\"" bullets, not \""real\"" rape, and not \""real\"" blood.Purposefully held to the end of my comments is the announcement that the film is written, directed and produced by Angelina Jolie. We are aware of her humanitarian efforts and here she works diligently to tell a story that exposes the realities of war and how humanity can disappear. It's not a perfect film (it runs a bit long), but it tells a powerful story that many of us prefer to pretend doesn't exist. As with the Bosnia and Herzegovina citizens, we can't help but wonder what took NATO forces so long to get involved. Capped by an understated and haunting Gabriel Yared score, the film is tough to watch, but also a brutal reminder that war is the ultimate sacrifice and punishment for real people and real families.","[""the film is written, directed and produced by angelina jolie. it's a brutal reminder that war is the ultimate sacrifice and punishment for real people. the movie is not a perfect film.""]","['greetings again from the darkness. the bosnian war is not something most americans know much about. the cursory western media coverage was matched by the hands - off approach from the un, until the very end. this movie doesn\'t stray away from exposing the atrocities of ethnic cleansing and genocide that occurred against civilians. the comparisons to nazi war camps are inescapable. this is no place for a history lesson, and i would certainly not be the one to supply it, but some basics are required to somewhat understand what\'s going on. the reign of yugoslavian president tito lasted until his death in 1980. although much criticism is directed his way, he was able to maintain a society that allowed the non - existence of bosniak muslims and orthodox serbs. you might recall that in 1984, sarajevo hosted the winter olympics. not long after that, the republics began skirmishes that eventually escalated to a complicated civil war lasting from 1992 - 95 ( the bosnian war ). the film makes no attempt to capture the full scope of the war, instead choosing a microscopic approach by focusing on two people. danijel ( goran kostic ) and ajla ( zana marjanovic ) are dancing cozily in a club when a bomb shatters their date and subsequent lives. danijel goes on to becomes a mid - level military leader of the serbs, while ajla and her muslim family and friends are torn over, some even executed. ajla ends up as a prisoner at the camp danijel commands. he manages to protect her from the brutal rapes by soldiers by staking a claim on her and putting the order out that she is not to be touch. ajla is an artist and danijel is family soldier and their earlier dance evolves into a psychological battle of wits, mistrust and escape. danijel is clearly not of the mindset to be more brutal killer within a war, yet ajla constantly observes his every movement and even the slightest change in his approach to her and the war. she does what she trusts to survive and he uses her as an escape from the atrocities of his both shocking and inevitable. danijel\'s father, nebojsa, is a high level military leader who shows up in time to provide us such a abbreviated history lesson dating back 600 years. he takes much pride in the serbs ability to persevere. nebojsa is played by rade serbedzija, whom many will recognize as the villain from the saint ( 1997 ) and boris the blade in snatch ( 2000 ). this is a powerful and frightening character, and we quickly understand why he doubts his son\'s fortitude. when he finds out about ajla, we immediately know things are going to get ugly. after the screening, we were fortunate enough to have a discussion panel sponsored by the world affairs council. one of the panel members was a former officer in the bosnian army who spent time in two separate concentration camps. viewing the film was very emotional for him and he said it captured the realities as well as a movie possibly could. of course, we never lose sight of the fact that what we see on screen are not \\ "" real \\ "" bullets, not \\ "" literal \\ "" rape, and not \\ "" real \\ "" blood. purposefully held to the end of my comments is the announcement that the film is written, directed and produced by angelina jolie. we are aware of her humanitarian efforts and here she works diligently to tell a story that exposes the realities of war and how humanity can disappear. it\'s not a perfect film ( it runs a bit long ), but it tells a powerful story that many of us prefer to pretend doesn\'t exist. as with the bosnia and herzegovina citizens, we displace\'t help but wonder what took nato forces so long to get involved. capped by an understated and haunting gabriel yared score, the film is problematical to watch, but also a brutal reminder that war is the ultimate sacrifice and punishment for real people and real families.']"
123,0.0,"OK, so I've read the books twice and thought they were great, so I went to the cinema with my sister who hadn't read the books yet to see this film which I'd been looking forward to for ages.Biggest movie mistake ever! The actors were, to put it bluntly, crap. There was absolutely no chemistry whatsoever between any characters. The acting was so wooden and the lines so cheesy that I literally covered my eyes at some points in embarrassment! Kirsten Stewart is extremely miscast as Bella. Every sentence she uttered was peppered with sighs, um's and halting stuttering speech, which basically made me want to throw something at the screen after a while. The only time this varied was the hospital scene. Edward tells her he'd be better off leaving her, and she does raise her voice an octave, even if it was a laughable delivery in what should have been a serious scene.I wonder if anyone told the actors that they can vary their tone and pitch when speaking, or if they were told to deliver every line in the same boring monotone? The effects were horrendous, the flash back of Carlisle and the werewolves was totally unnecessary and something a child could have come up with. I mean, great costumes guys! Just stick a flat cap on and some breeches and away we go! There we have a genuine flash back! My sister and I were in stitches for all the wrong reasons, mainly the bit where Edward sucks out the venom from Bella and the expression on his face when he's doing it! I mean, does he always go cross eyed when he feeds or what? It must have rubbed off on Bella anyway cos she was also cross eyed in this scene. Maybe it was an outtake they forgot to remove? The other characters don't get enough screen time for me to have an opinion of, but I do hope they use Alice more in the next film. She's the only one who seems to have a bit of promise.I hope Kirsten Stewart gets her finger out for New Moon, seeing as we're supposed to believe she's so in love with Edward she cant live without him. In Twilight it came across to me like he annoyed her a bit and she could take him or leave him really.Bad casting, bad effects and really bad directing made this film for me the years biggest flop.

It has the charm of the good old stupid comedies, so it will appeal to those who enjoy those types, but it proves to be very witty and well written as well.

You're moving into a land of both awe and \n awfulness, of fantasy and romance. You've just crossed over into the \n Twilight Zone! In New Moon, the story left off with Bella and Edward \n having averted danger. Eclipse continues the saga with a completely new \n and fresh idea. Bella is still in danger! I know right? It blew my \n mind. This time around the danger comes from an unknown source. It \n could be Victoria, who seeks revenge on Edward for killing her love, \n James, in the first movie. Or it could be the Volturi, who have a \n distinct interest in Edward, Alice, and Bella. Their enemy is stronger \n than the Cullen clan can handle on their own, but luckily they have an \n ace in the hole - an unlikely alliance with the wolves. The result is \n the most beautifully filmed fight sequence so far in The Twilight Saga.\n \n But what really makes this movie better than the previous two \n (especially for those who aren't already fans of the books) is the \n dialogue and the high school drama. Not because they're good, but \n because they're entertaining. My compliments to Stephenie Meyer. She \n has the uncanny ability to create the most epic of awkward situations \n whose silence is broken only by the most ludicrous dialogue. My \n favorite scene in the movie is when Bella, Edward and Jacob are in a \n tent in a snowstorm. Awkward - check. Bella is freezing cold and \n Edward's lifeless body can't do a thing. The shirtless Jacob steps in \n saying,\n \n Face it, I'm hotter than you.\n \n and gets under the covers and Bella snuggles up against his warm chest. \n Edward can only watch. Epic - check. Good only gets better when Jacob \n then suggests,\n \n It'd be faster if you took your clothes off... survival 101 Ludicrous - \n check. I stood up, applauded, and walked out.\n \n With the relationships between Bella, Edward and Jacob established by \n the first two movies, Eclipse is chock-full of one-liners that are \n entertaining. And watching the 3 interact and bump heads can be quite \n funny because as an adult you are reminded of how \""love\"" is so \n simplistic and idealistic in the minds of teenagers. What consumes more \n of my mental energy than deserved is how Bella is so irrationally \n attracted to Edward and Jacob, and the two to her. From her \n perspective, she could probably do better than an undead boyfriend \n whose instinct is to drink her blood and a wolf boy who's so angry all \n the time. And what happen to women's equality? Does she really need two \n unnatural male protectors? From Edward's and Jacob's perspectives, \n they're fighting over a girl who can't seem to make up her mind about \n who she wants more. It might even appear that she's playing them both \n for fools. Guys do wait - but not forever. But I'm letting the my \n rational side prevent me from enjoying the movie. So if you're headed \n out to watch Eclipse with your girlfriend or little sister, lighten up \n and you might enjoy the movie.\n \n Thus ends review #3. Bella loves Edward. Edward loves Bella. Jacob \n loves Bella. Bella loves Edward. Perhaps Breaking Dawn will take it \n from epic to classic when Edward and Jacob love each other.

(The background sounds--the \""subtle\"" music that was playing while the characters talked, or sounds of walking, just any ambient noise--was so loud that it covered much of the dialogue, and the sound effects of the war were headache-inducingly loud--don't know if that is the movie itself, or the theater--but why wouldn't the dialogue have been louder as well if it was the theater?).

Back in middle school, I kept hearing about this book series called Twilight. I thought to myself: What is Twilight and why's everyone into it?So a few days later (or so according to memory), I asked my mom to buy a copy of the book, so I could read it and see if it was as good as people said. I took the book home, read a few pages, and was instantly bored from the beginning. I didn't even finish it to this very day from which I post this review.Sparkling vampires?! Really?! Last time I checked the definition of vampire on Wikipedia, vampires DO NOT SPARKLE. (well maybe in Stephenie Meyers' imagination, sure.)Sorry. I got a bit carried away with the book. Now let me review this title.This is what Twilight is about (in a nutshell). Girl moves to Oregon and lives with dad. Girl is a new girl. Girl meets boy. Girl finds out that boy is a vampire, a SPARKLING one. Girl is introduced to sparkling vampire boy's family. And, I don't feel like explaining everything else because Twilight was just too boring for me. (:P)Character development: I didn't finish the book or movie so I don't care. ???/10Dialogue: Seemed pretty bland. Still boring. 3/10Plot: Boring. Just boring.

192,0.0,"12 Angry Men is entertaining, mostly well acted, and worth a watch. It could have been far better but, from the outset, the film was designed only to take a pot-shot at the Right, and promote a Left Wing Progressive viewpoint as the absolute truth. This story is hardcore propaganda and, judging by its score on IMDb, has succeeded in fooling a great number of people. What is interesting to me is that the Left-wing's brainwashing started this early. Hollywood is still churning out the same bias today (go and read my Dark Knight review).The movie has a very interesting premise: An open-and-shut case is called in to question when one man on the twelve-man jury slowly convinces the others that the eighteen year old on trial for the murder of his father may, in fact, be innocent. That's got some real potential, hasn't it? Sadly, the gone-in-the-head Leftist who wrote this did what I feared he would: loaded the dice and peddled a Leftist agenda - namely one that excuses criminals of their actions and seeks to end the death penalty. That's the film's overwhelming goal. It wants the audience to come away from the movie, not with a greater appreciation of the legal system, but with the view that the death penalty should be abolished and that anyone who objects to this is a deluded, little bigot. Let's look at the facts we are given:-Spoilers from here on- 1. An 18 year old is on trial for the murder of his father. He has no alibi. The alibi he gave to police (that he was in a theatre the whole time) fell apart when he could not recall anything about the movies that were showing - even their names.2. There are two main witnesses: One saw the defendant leaving the scene of the crime (and heard the event); the other saw the murder take place through a window and identified the defendant. The defendant was also heard shouting in anger 'I'm gonna kill you', the same day as the murder.3. The knife (with a very rare design) used in the murder is the same knife that the defendant had bought earlier and was carrying around. His friends testified to this effect.4. The defendant is an habitual criminal who has had numerous run-ins with the law, including two arrests for knife fighting. He is said to be 'real handy with a knife'.5. The defendant has a clear motive: His father was repeatedly violent and abusive towards him, and had beaten him regularly (with fists) since he was five years of age, including the day of the murder.I was intrigued. Why does this one juror believe the defendant may not be guilty? How could he convince the rest that there is reasonable doubt? Despite the fact I feared these questions would receive fob-offs, I was still hopeful an intelligent investigation would be crafted around them. But no. Straight away, the film deliberately loads the dice by having certain jurors holding prejudiced or otherwise undesirable traits, while the dissenting voice is calm, collected, and supremely open-minded. That's clich\u00e9, and a very common Leftist tactic (you'll see it a lot on shows like Star Trek).The film takes each of the facts above and finds an absurd alternate explanation for them, such as the knife could have fallen out of the defendants pocket and the true murderer used an identical knife (this is the fantastic explanation given by our Leftist hero). The film has a moronic moment where the 'hero' pulls out a knife he has bought (illegally), which appears identical to the one in question. The idea being that it isn't so rare, after all.Other silly moments include the jury discussing why the defendant would come home a few hours later if he had indeed done the crime. Not one of them mentions that the defendant lives there and would have to come back home in order to allay fears that he was the murderer. It's part of an alibi. What else is he going to do, disappear and hope that the police don't find that a tad suspicious? Nearly every explanation given in favour of the defendant is absurd or complete conjecture.When you string all the known facts together, the chances of them all being explained away in a fashion that exonerates the defendant is literally millions to one. It's so implausible that no sane jury would acquit. But the writer wants this to happen, so it does (and 12-0 in favour, just in case you missed the point). I love it when writers do that. Don't you? At one point, the following dialogue takes place:\""No-one can know a thing like that; this isn't an exact science.\"" \""That's right, it isn't.\"" Okay, then, let's just forget putting people on trial because we can hardly ever be 100% sure that they did the crime in question, can we? The number of victims created by having no deterrent, or by allowing dangerous criminals to go free, is FAR GREATER than the absolute minority case where an innocent person is found guilty. Some people cannot be reasoned with and are far too broken to be rehabilitated. They are like a dangerous dog. We don't try to change the nature of a dangerous dog because we know it's futile, and we know that by ignoring it, we are just risking more innocent lives. This really isn't rocket science, it's just that the Leftist types (who have a huge stranglehold on the media/TV) refuse to budge, and muddy the waters with their insane Progressive agenda.People cheering this movie are cheering for a violent thug, who got away with first-degree murder. It's not hip, it's just dumb.

197,0.0,"Naruto and Hinata share a clich\u00e9d love story. Something I like and something that the today's storytelling world has come to lack. It is a story between a Flamboyant but a simple man and shy but humble woman.She is the only one to see past his strong demeanor. She sees his loneliness, his heart-ache, his failures, his struggles behind the confident man. She looks over him from the shadows from childhood to maturity. But the man does not see her, she remains unnoticed by him almost every time they cross paths. She is the heiress to the most rich, influential clan in the village and the orphan is penniless and is looked down upon by everyone. They are far apart, very far apart. Until destiny brings them together in a dramatic set of events.Critically speaking, as a love story, it builds on the emotions of the audiences slowly and steadily. The moments between the main couple are heart-warming. There is a general lack of good love stories in the media everywhere. So in this case I enjoyed The Last as a pure, decent love story. It shows love in a different way. It's not physical attraction that connects Naruto and Hinata but how they sacrifice and compromise for each other that leads them to loving each other eventually.The whole theme of Naruto is centered on love. All kinds of love. Family, Friends, Teachers and Romance of course. Naruto conquered his friends and got acknowledged by all. He met his parents' spirits, he got strong admiration and respect from his teachers but his life still is empty if you look at it that way. Based on Masashi Kishimoto's review that Naruto's last struggle will be love in a romantic way. He was rejected by Sakura mainly because she couldn't come upto terms to leave Sasuke and love Naruto. Naruto being the ever nice guy with a heart of gold, he accepts that. But at the same time he doesn't accept Hinata's confession immediately. He gives himsefl time to get over sakura's rejection, and actually see for himself how much Hinata loves him and has cared for him from past to present.Now every movie is not the same. There are movies with exceptioal rating and high gross earnings. At the same time there are movies with low ratings but High gross earnings. We can't deny that Naruto earned 1.47 Billion Yen on its opening day. That's a big number! SO judging the movie based on the comments and ratings will not be helpful.I personally liked the love story, the emotional build up, the character development of the Characters in a different way. The movie did not move from Shonen to Shojo, Instead it acknowledged that times are changing. There is more women involvement and a focus on love more than ever. Boys need love too you know. In this case I like it how Hinata and Naruto interact with each other. It has an essence of love, comfort, purity and genuine care for each other instead of plain physical attraction that can easily fade away.","['""the last"" is a love story between a simple man and a shy but humble woman. it shows love in a different way, not physical attraction. the movie did not move from Shonen to Shojo, instead it acknowledged that times are changing.']","[""naruto and hinata share a clich \\ u00e9d love story. something i like and something that the today's storytelling world has come to lack. it is a story between a flamboyant but a simple man and shy but humble woman. she is the only one to see past his strong demeanor. she sees this loneliness, his heart - ache, his failures, his battle behind the confident man. she looks over him from the shadows from childhood to maturity. but the man does not see sakura, she remains unnoticed by him almost every time they cross paths. she is the heiress to the most rich, influential clan in the village and the orphan is penniless and is looked down upon by everyone. they are far apart, very far apart. until destiny brings them together in a dramatic set of events. critically speaking, as a love story, it builds on both emotions of the audiences slowly and steadily. the moments is a general lack of good love stories in the box everywhere. so in this case i enjoyed the last as a pure, decent love story. it shows love in a different way. it's not physical attraction that connects naruto and hinata but how they sacrifice and compromise for each early that leads them to loving each other eventually. the whole theme of naruto is center on love. all kinds of love. family, friends, teachers and romance of course. naruto conquered his emotions and got acknowledged by all. he met his parents'spirits, he got strong admiration but respect from his instructor but his life still is empty if you look at it that much. based on masashi kishimoto's review that naruto's last struggle will be love in a romantic way. he was rejected by sakura mainly because she couldn't come upto terms to leave sasuke and love naruto. naruto being the ever nice guy with a heart of iron, he accepts that. although at the same time atomic rooster 2 doesn't accept hinata's confession immediately. he gives himsefl time to get over sakura's rejection, and actually see for himself how much hinata love him and has cared for him from past to present. now every movie is not the same. there are movies with exceptioal rating and high gross earnings. at the same time there are movies with down in the mouth ratings but high gross earnings. we can't deny that naruto earned 1. 47 billion yen on its opening day. that's a big number! so judging the movie based on the comments and ratings will not be helpful. i personally liked the love story, the emotional build up, the character development of the characters in a different way. the movie did not move from shonen to shojo, instead it acknowledged that times are changing. there is more women involvement and a focus on love more than ever. boys need love too you know. in this case i like it how hinata and naruto interact with each other. it has an essence of love, comfort, purity and genuine care for each other instead of plain physical attraction that can easily fade away.""]"

The plot is forced into contortions to segue into dance and/or music scenes.This movie tries to capture some indie-flick grit and street cred, but it can't shuck its Hollywood origins or its happy Hollywood ending.There are lavish special effects showing the wonders of the drug experience. There is lots of music, including a cameo by Bono that unlike most of the other music scenes is almost entirely close-up face shots. Hey, they got Bono, and they wanted to make the most of it.Actually, there *was* a close-up face shot of Prudence (most of the characters are named from Beatles songs) that showed an unrealistic three ear piercings, making me wonder at that early stage exactly when the movie was supposed to be taking place. Prudence, a repressed lesbian, gazes longingly after a series of women. At one point, in a too-obvious and insufficiently-funny scene, Prudence locks herself in a closet, at which all of her friends ask her to come out - their cue to sing \""Dear Prudence\"". The movie is loaded with that sort of \""wit\"".There was a consistently strange disregard for little details... For instance, there were several street corner scenes where the buildings were painted to look stereotypically \""sixties\"", but the set dressing ignored large swaths of non-foreground scenery.I just can't condone a pro-drug movie like this.

In the beginning they use this for a bit of fun before beginning to take on the faith of human uprising, gathering the adults and working together to take down the big enemy and its human supporters.Since I had seen the first Trailer of this some time ago on another Premiere screening I was really looking forward to see this movie. Of course cast names like Sir Ben Kingsley or Gillian Anderson pull viewers on this flick, but it is the youngsters like the Australian Callan McAuliffe or Ella Hunt who in the end positively surprise in their roles.During the Movie we learn that the Robots are trying to learn from the humans and some humans are helping them with this task guided by Mediators of the Robots. Sir Ben Kingsley as a supporter of the Robots who in the final loses importance to them and gets killed as well plays his role as eccentric collaborator brilliantly. He is just cool as the rather careless bad guy.Gillian Anderson in the role of the former Teacher and Mother was surprising different as known from other movies I remember to have watched with her.

243,0.0,"The future is here. Earth has a significant problem as it continues to heat up more and more, making it an unliveable planet. The only way the people of Earth can get by is to investigate and find a new home.Thirty young men and women are selected for a critical mission. The selection includes some of the finest young people of Earth who are well educated and healthy. Leading the mission is Richard (Colin Farrell), who is quite passionate to support the crew as much as possible. To the young people, he is a teacher, counsellor, and a general close friend. The mission will take over eighty years, which means the young people selected will never get to see their new home, but their purpose is to create new life once they are the appropriate age, and then the next generation will save the entire world.The mission is in progress, but Christopher (Tye Sheridan) &amp; Zac (Fionn Whitehead) begin to question a few elements on the ship. They examine a blue liquid that they must drink daily and wonder why certain areas on the ship are hidden. What starts as a minor act of rebellion becomes a path of madness and paranoia, not just for Christopher and Zac but for the entire onboard crew. They also begin to question each other on topics such as leadership, affections and trust. To make matters worse, the team are also on edge as they learn there could be the threat of an alien creature on the ship. Can the mission be completed to save Earth? Will members of the ship survive the chaos?Visually, I found Voyagers to be rather pleasing. The world of outer space and future technology concepts on the ship were rather creative and great to see, and elements such as the sound effects were also outstanding. As a plot, Voyagers has a slow start. Once we see the ship members begin to raise questions and take risks, I was generally curious to know what will happen next. I was also questioning if the ship did really have an alien creature on board.But sadly, Voyagers is not a simple watch. While Voyagers delivers a pleasing world of space and sci-fi, the film's plot is quite messy. We witness characters doing repeated things: questioning the truth, arguing over leadership, exhibiting trust issues, and seeing teenagers discover their emotions and sexual feelings for the first time. While such discovery seems like an interesting concept for the first time, the film reveals these aspects in a repetitive, confusing manner. It is also frustrating watching these so-called intelligent youth make continually unwise choices.The film is also entirely predictable, contains cheesy performances, and there are some moments that I generally found awkward to watch. Watching a teenager touch a young girl without her permission for the first time with no real consequences, even from an adult figure, was extremely disappointing to see. Make note; this is not the type of film to share on a first date.The editing here is also questionable. There are moments where characters discuss an issue or have conflict only to get distracted by another issue that is occurring elsewhere, and the dispute is suddenly ignored. The film does not flow well, and scenes feel disjointed, failing to bring continuous flow to the story. After the film, I questioned if many cuts and edits were made for the sake of the film's runtime. For the most part, performances were fine, but by the third act, characters become more laughable than serious as they deliver lines that are just unfitting, cheesy and over the top.Overall, while I enjoy the concept of a group of youth travelling to a new planet to save the world and visually Voyagers has a few genuinely pleasing aspects as a sci-fi movie, it is messy and awkward. The editing is questionable, making scenes feel more disjointed rather than seamless. The film is also incredibly predictable regarding its mysteries. The plot elements feel repetitive as we watch the ship's crew bicker and argue over the same topic repeatedly to the point the film becomes laughable instead of something more exciting and memorable.

301,0.0,"This movie is simply awful and painful to watch honestly. I read all the books and although the writing is not that good in the books either the movie is worse. Bella's acting is completely annoying, she can't give a convincing line, no chemistry between her and Edward either. She has the same facial movements throughout the entire movie (unfortunately not more than 3). Edward is in this movie only to remind the teens of how gorgeous he is and that's it. In each one of his lines he looks like he's in pain or he's gonna throw up (same thing I noticed about Pattinson in 'Remember me'). Not to mention the fact he's wearing some kind of lipstick which is wrong on so many levels. Jacob's performance isn't worth mentioning because I am convinced he wasn't designed to act. His sole reason for being in this movie is given by the amount of muscles he grew. Not once in this horrendous 2 hours movie have I felt that he's genuinely in love with Bella. The rest of the characters are simply props because they don't give any cohesion whatsoever in the plot, they are just killing time until the sequences with Bella and Edward appear. I put my hopes and dreams that at least the famous 'blanket scene' will capture something of the books essence but it failed dramatically. It seems that the actors are just repeating the lines, they have no feeling, no empathy, anyone from the street could have done this scene better. The details about the Cullen members' transformation into vampires should have been stretched into a second part of the movie. There are too many things that are included in this movie to make it look like the book, that ruin the movie for good. It's like a soup inflated with too many ingredients.

314,0.0,"I was very disappointed by two major things in the movie: the action and the chemistry.After preparing us for the \""epic\"" battle with the newborns through the entire movie, the actual fight lasts only about 5 minutes. You barely start enjoying all the action and it's over!! David Slade made such a fuss about this for absolutely NOTHING. Plus his camera is sometimes shaky and blurred like an amateur Youtube clip (scene with Bella and Jacob in his garage and even worse the scene where Riley bends over Charlie).The chemistry is also non existent, and it's mainly due to Bella. I could feel that Edward and Jacob love her, but I never felt anything from her. It just looks like she only wants sex with Edward, and that she's physically attracted to Jacob (since Edward won't comply to her advances). The bubbling tension from Twilight is all but spent, and Edward's proposal throwing in chaperoned walks, ice tea on the porch and stolen kisses literally made me cringe and cover my eyes. It is a good lesson for teenagers not to have sex on the first date and maybe feel something for the person you share your bed with besides lust, but from that to \""don't have sex before marriage\"" is utterly absurd and unwise. Marriage is pretty serious stuff, you won't go into that without being sure of ALL the aspects of your relationship. But the Mormon beliefs of Stephanie Meyer get here the upper hand, so like it or not you get a taste of her convictions. Poor Robert Pattinson must have had a hard time getting those lines out! Acting...well, I will confess I'm not watching the Twilight movies for the fine acting. I thought Taylor Lautner the best of the trio. Surprisingly good performances from Jackson Rathbone and especially Nicki Reed. Best acting was without a doubt Billy Burke. The music is really A+, too bad the quality of the movie is not rising up to the quality of the music! Howard Shore composed an epic score, and the soundtrack is amazing, with all songs fitting the scenes to perfection.Best kiss: Jacob/Bella. Not emotional, but sexy. Best couple: Alice/Jasper.

The film adaptation of New Moon, on the other hand, doesn't really work, on multiple levels.

On the other end of the scale, while Bella Swan wasn't exactly an all-time-great heroine in the first film, here she's barely tolerable. She becomes ridiculously depressed after Edward leaves her (to the point of screaming in her sleep as though she's being tortured), her interactions with Jacob are unstable to the point that you feel she's leading him on, and when Alice Cullen reappears on the scene, Bella's desperation that she not immediately leave again seems pathetic and needy.

359,0.0,"Much better Twilight number three story compared to the disastrous second installment, The New Moon. Story concentrates to describe the newly found love between wolf boy Jacob (Lautner) and human girl Bella (Stewart), her old love to vampire boy Edward (Pattinson), and dealings with vengeful vampire Victoria (Howard) and her new army, together with the all the matters vampires leave behind when crossing over.Story is much more fluent and active, dialogs slightly improved, acting more or less same. The inserts of new born vampire army together with the back-stories of Cullen vampires Jasper (Rathbone) and Rosalie (Reed) were refreshing reliefs from continuous Bella/Jacob affair. The fighting scene, apparently THE last fight there will be, was well made, albeit short. The vampires were suddenly moving much slower. Editing works and the cinematography is really breath taking. The new wolf pack members had improved CGI bodies, they actually started to look like wolfs; someone has been finally studying animal anatomy. There were still problems with the scaling; the distance and the wolf size didn't change accordingly. Was this why close up of Jacob's hairy tail shows no balls? It is obvious that Rosenberg tried to update Bella to be more appealing to modern women. In the fight scene, she takes an active role saving Edward from decapitation distracting Victoria and Riley with her blood, in the end of the film she is really not choosing between boys but who she is as a person (they fooled me for awhile), she is the one who figures out who is behind the army, she does not do cooking/laundry to her father anymore, instead Charlie (Burke) is asking if she wants to have a sandwich, she complains Edward being old fashioned (he is from Victorian era) not having sex with her before marriage and she tells Edward she wants to keep her own name when married. Unfortunately, together with the hassling between Jacob/Edward it made the story contradicting itself and left a desperate aftertaste. Too much effort was made to play in all camps.If you think this story has been about love, in the end of this movie you are told otherwise. A lot of effort is put to bring Jacob forward as a worthy suitor; long stares and dialogs, love confessions, choose me moments and a neon highlighting to underline the fact that it is possible to love more than one person at the time. On the way he tries to prove this by forcing himself on her and wishing Bella really would better dead than one of the vampires, and finally joining forces with Cullens to protect her. Eventually all culminates to a long-long-long ultimate kiss at the top of the snowy mountain, camera rolling around them in different angles. The fact that the recent fianc\u00e9 Edward, to whom Bella is engaged to be married, is watching this all is not allowed to bring any consequences, the concepts of infidelity and betrayal are not even mentioned. Bella is actively seeking Jacob's company throughout the movie and hiding the engagement ring, pointing out her feelings for him; every character in the movie is made to play a role to emphasize this. Even the scene where Jacob is crushed by a new born is moved later in the story so that Bella can go to him, and even though the Cullen's are standing right beside they are still last to arrive to his rescue.Jacobs's value as a right choice is like secretly added by showing scenes throughout the movie of what Bella would be leaving behind as a vampire. Bella's mother (Clarke) is giving a trip-T-shirt blanket hoping future and children for her, Jessica's (Kendrick) graduation speech of value of mistakes and possibilities to change one's mind, father Charlie telling he would look for her forever if she ever goes missing, Rosalie's story and her wish of still having a possibility to grow old and being surrounded by grandchildren, and Edward's pain of condemning her to go through all that sacrifice because of him.Explanation/s why Jacob would be just a right for Bella is actually quite well done, too well in the end. After all this one has to wonder why the vampire boy is still around? This is explained in two last scenes, in case viewer is confused. In the dialogs between Jacob and Bella, Jacob complains how difficult it was to make Bella confess her feelings for him. Bella answers she only fought against it because it wouldn't change anything (so why she led him on all two movies if she knew this all along?). Laconically Jacob states \""if love would only be enough\"" (= if it would be enough Bella would have chosen Jacob) and hints he would be waiting for her even after her heart stops beating. Was this leaving the door open to be continued? In the last scene Bella is making a monologue to verbalize the point of all this to Edward: \""This wasn't a choice between you and Jacob. It was a choice who I should be and who I am\"". After this is explanation how she feels outsider as a human/body and how she is more herself in a world of vampires. To this Edward asks \""so this wasn't about me\"", and Bella \""sorry, no\"". So, Bella wants to be a vampire, therefore she will be with Edward, and Edward is to be her trophy husband. In the end Bella has all the choices, and a right to love multiple persons. Edward is left alone with Bella, and Jacob is doomed to imprint. Love really ain't enough, not even in the world of fantasy. Girl has to eat, and sometimes girl wants to eat some blood.","['a lot of effort was made to bring forward Jacob as a worthy suitor. the film\'s ending leaves a desperate aftertaste.

it is obvious that rosenberg tried to update bella to be more appealing to modern cleaning woman. in fire fight scene, she takes an active role saving edward from decapitation distracting victoria and riley with her blood, in the end of the film she is really not choosing between boys but who she is as a person ( they fooled me for awhile ), she is the one who figures out who is behind the army, she does not do cooking / laundry to her father anymore, instead charlie ( burke ) is asking if she wants to have a sandwich, she complains edward too old fashioned ( he is from victorian era ) not having sex with bella before marriage and already tells edward she wants a keep her own name when married. unfortunately, together with the hassling between jacob / edward it made the story contradicting itself and left a desperate aftertaste. too much effort was made to find in all camps. if you think this story has been about love, in the end of this movie you are told otherwise. a lot of effort is put to bring jacob forward as a worthy suitor ; long stares and dialogs, love confessions, choose me moments and a neon highlighting to underline the fact that it is possible to love way he tries to prove this by forcing himself on her and wishing bella really would better dead than one of the vampires, and finally joining military unit with cullens to protect her. eventually all culminates to a long - long - long ultimate kiss at the top of the snowy mountain, camera rolling around them in different angles. the fact that the recent fianc \\ u00e9 edward, to whom bella is engaged to be married, is watching this all is not allowed to bring any consequences, the concepts of infidelity and betrayal are not even mentioned. bella is actively seeking jacob\'s company throughout the movie and hiding the engagement ring, pointing out her feelings for him ; every character in the movie is made to play a role to emphasize this. even the scene where jacob be crushed by a new born is moved later in the story so that bella can go to him, and even though the cullen\'s are standing right beside they are still last to arrive to his rescue. jacobs\'s value as a right choice is like secretly added by showing scenes throughout the movie of what bella would be leaving behind as a vampire. bella\'south mother ( clarke ) is giving a trip - t - shirt blanket hoping future and children for her, jessica\'s ( kendrick ) graduation speech of value of mistakes and possibilities to change one\'s mind, father charlie telling he would look for her forever if she ever goes missing, rosalie\'s story and her wish of still having a possibility to grow old and being surrounded by grandchildren, and edward\'s pain of condemning her to go through all that sacrifice because of him. explanation / s why jacob would be just a right for bella is actually quite well done, too well in the end. after all this one has to wonder why the vampire boy is still around? this is explained in two last scenes, in case viewer is confused. in the dialogs between jacob and bella, jacob complains how difficult it was to make bella confess her feelings for him. bella answers she only fought against it because it wouldn\'t change anything ( so why she led him on all two movies if she knew this all along? ). laconically jacob states \\ "" if love would only be enough \\ "" ( = if it would be enough bella would have chosen jacob ) and hints he would be waiting for her even after her heart stops beating. was this leaving the door open to be continued? in the last scene bella is making a monologue to verbalize the point of all this to edward : \\ "" this wasn\'t a choice between you and jacob. it was a choice who i should be and who i am \\ "". after this is explanation how she feels outsider as a human / body and how she is more herself in a world of vampires. to this edward asks \\ "" so this wasn\'t about me \\ "", and bella \\ "" sorry, no \\ "". so, bella wants to be a vampire, therefore she will be with edward, and edward is to be her trophy husband. in the end bella has all the choices, and a right to love multiple persons. edward is left alone with bella, and jacob is doomed to imprint. love really ain\'t enough, not even in the world of fantasy. girl has to eat, and sometimes girl wants to eat some blood.']"
360,0.0,"Lots of money, lots of CGI, high-powered cast, half-assed story. That about sums up the latest Joss Whedon extravaganza.**spoilers** The story: clunky. It doesn't flow easily.

The Avengers tries to present them as reluctant, and egotistical (which of course they luckily overcome), but they've already been through things like this in their own films. Why have they regressed? Perhaps the reason is that Hollywood largely eschews the time-tested concept of character growth for flashy SFX that the kiddies like so much. It's sad, and results in hollow films. Like The Avengers, for example.The CGI: Pretty good, but has flying worms ala the latest Transformers flick, but not as cool.The cast: Not too bad.

369,0.0,"(minor spoilers inasmuch as I mention some violent highlights) Park Chan-wook continues his individual style of extreme (and extremely creative) violence that he displayed to us in Sympathy for Mr Vengeance. For instance, there is removal of teeth without anaesthetic, self-mutilation, single-handed destruction of a gang of thugs by one man using a claw-tooth hammer. Odd bit of sexual violence and nakedness just in case we thought this was a movie suitable for the kids.The plot is reasonably inventive - a man who is incarcerated for 15 years and isn't told why. When he gets out he creates a path of mayhem trying to escape the web of his enemies. then the plot thickens. One thing that Chan-wook is good at is twisting the audience's emotional sympathies after showing how thoroughly nasty all the characters are. Suddenly we are shown things in a different light. Even the opening scene where a man is being dangled off a rooftop held by another man simply by his necktie is not what it seems. The inventive ending reveals some of the twisted underpinning that is vaguely reminiscent of Kill Bill. Unlike Tarantino however, Park Chan-wook's violence isn't stylised - it's stomach-churningly realistic.

370,0.0,"Directed by Edward Zwick, \""The Last Samurai\"" is the story of Civil War veteran Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), a man who is fighting his inner demons that originated from some actions against Native Americans that he didn't feel so good about. So he drinks a lot and is a freelance military adviser. His latest assignment is to go to Tokyo with some former colleagues and train the Emperor's troops in modern weaponry so they can defeat the last of the country's Samurai. During their first battle, he is captured by the Samurai who then take him under their wing, helping him heal his wounds and teaching him how to fight, etc. When the time comes to return back to his \""rightful\"" place, he makes the choice to fight with the Samurai, who he now relates to most of all.I'll say it right out of the box\u0085 I really didn't like this movie that much. The film drowns in clich\u00e9s: The slow motion fight scenes, the shots of Cruise in silhouette at sundown, practicing his moves, the screams of \""Noooooooooo\"" as the incredibly wounded men charge, and Cruise getting knocked down five times during one of his early sparring matches, yet refusing to stay down because he's just a scrappy guy\u0085 these are just a couple of the things I found myself rolling my eyes at. I rolled my eyes at those scenes, I chuckled at the fact that he managed to keep a perfectly trimmed beard and clothes that miraculously cleaned themselves after a fight in the rain and mud, and was actually howling during Cruise's detox scene in which he yells \""Sake!!!!!!!!!!\"" over and over. But I was downright confused after the fight in the alley between Omura's henchmen and Cruise; we experienced the fight once, then suddenly he goes slo-mo and we have to watch the entire fight all over again. Why?! Don't even get me started on the ending. When he walked through the door to chat with the Emperor I almost fell out of my seat; I couldn't believe the film would seriously end that way.I did not hate everything about the film. I thought that Ken Watanabe was phenomenal, and I really liked the fact that they spoke a lot of Japanese. I can't stand it when films think we assume that everyone in the world speaks flawless English. I think that the decision to keep the native language as pervasive as it was, was a good thing. The ninja scene was good, and there were also some great shots; particularly landscapes. However, these things only raise my opinion up from an extremely low position, they don't save the film for me. It was ironic that I watched this when I did because I watched \""Rashomon\"" the day before, a film that was made 55 years prior, on a tiny fraction of the budget of \""The Last Samurai\"", which got me thinking about Kurosawa. Of course, it is very difficult to compare Kurosawa to most filmmakers of this genre because he is pure genius, but conversely, it is sad that a film that does have the benefit of finances and precedents could make such a pale comparison. Also, when did someone decide that Tony Goldwyn was going to be THE bad guy in every movie ever made? It's become almost clich\u00e9 at this point; go figure that he would be a part of THIS film.I suppose if you like Tom Cruise, historical epics, or action films you should see \""The Last Samurai\"", but it is barely mediocre, and although I had low expectations going in, I was still very disappointed. Merely because of the handful of positive aspects of the film, I give it a 5/10, a generous assignation in my opinion.--Shelly","['""The Last Samurai"" is the story of a civil war veteran fighting his inner demons. the film drowns in clichu00e9s: the slow motion fight scenes, the shots of Cruise in silhouette at sundown. it\'s sad that a film that does have the benefit of finances and precedents could make such a pale comparison.']","['directed by edward zwick, \\ "" when last samurai \\ "" is the story of civil war veteran nathan algren ( tom cruise ), a man who is fighting his inner demons that originated from some actions against native americans that he didn\'t feel so good about. so he drinks a lot and is a freelance military instructor. his latest assignment is to go to tokyo with some former colleagues and train the emperor\'s troops in modern weaponry so he can defeat the last of the country\'s samurai. during their first battle, he is captured by the samurai who then take him under their wing, helping him heal his wounds and teaching him how to fight, etc. when the time comes to return back to his \\ "" rightful \\ "" place, he makes the choice to fight with the samurai, who he now relates to most of all. i\'ll say it right out of the corner \\ u0085 i really didn\'t like this movie that much. the film drowns in clich \\ u00e9s : the slow motion fight scenes, the shots of cruise in silhouette at sundown, practicing his moves, the screams and \\ "" noooooooooo \\ "" as the implausibly wounded men enter, and cruise getting knocked down five times during one of his early sparring matches, yet refusing to stay down because he\'s just a scrappy guy \\ u0085 these are just a match of the things i found myself rolling my eyes at. i rolled my eyes at those scenes, i chuckled at beard and clothes that miraculously cleaned themselves after a fight in the rain and mud, and was actually howling during cruise\'s detox scene in which he yells \\ "" sake!!!!!!!!!! \\ "" over and over. but i was downright confused after the fight in the alley between omura\'s henchmen and cruise ; then experienced the fight once, then suddenly he goes slo - mo and we have to watch the entire fight all over again. why?! don\'t even get me started on the ending. when he walked through the door to meet with the emperor i almost fell out of my seat ; i couldn\'t think the moving picture show would seriously end that way. i did not hate everything about the film. i thought that ken watanabe was right, and atomic number 53 probably liked the fact that they spoke a lot of japanese. i can\'t stand it when films think we assume that everyone in the world speaks flawless english. i think that the decision to keep the native language as pervasive as it was, was a good thing. the ninja scene was good, and there were also some great shots ; particularly landscapes. however, these things only raise my opinion up from an extremely low position, they don\'t save the film for pine tree state. it was ironic that i watched this when i did because i watched \\ "" rashomon \\ "" the day before, a film that was made 55 years prior, on a tiny fraction of the budget of \\ "" the last samurai \\ "", which got me thinking about kurosawa. of course, it is very difficult to compare kurosawa to most filmmakers of this genre because he is pure genius, but conversely, it is sad that a film that does take the benefit of finances and precedents could make such a pale comparison. also, when did someone decide that tony goldwyn was going to be the bad guy in every movie ever made? it\'s become almost clich \\ u00e9 at this point ; go figure that he would be a part of this film. i suppose if you like tom cruise, historical epics, or action films you should see \\ "" the last samurai \\ "", but it is barely mediocre, and although i had low expectations going in, i was still very disappointed. merely because of the handful of positive aspects of the film, i consecrate it a 5 / 10, a generous assignation in my opinion. - - shelly']"

395,0.0,"This \""documentary\"" is actually a typical anti-Jewish polemic. In fact Steven Anderson lied to the Rabbis who were interviewed by telling them the interviews were for a neutral PBS documentary on Jewish history. In truth every minute of the film was filled with attacks on the Jews, such as \""Christ-killers\"" etc. Furthermore, the film contained a ton of misleading and blatantly false information on Jews.For example, it claimed that ALL Jews don't really believe in the Hebrew Bible on a literal level. This is utter nonsense as the vast majority of Orthodox Jews do believe in the Hebrew Bible literally.This was not helped by the fact that only one Orthodox Rabbi was interviewed, and even he appeared to be on the liberal-end of the Orthodox spectrum. Thus the movie based its attacks on the answers of the new liberal denomination Rabbis and took them to represent ALL Jews. As a result, half the movie was a strawman. Another example, is that in the movie, the Humanistic and Reform Rabbis answered that they don't really require circumcision or care about a lot of Old Testament laws like animal sacrifices. The movie then took that to be the case for ALL Jews. In reality Orthodox and many Conservative Rabbis do require full circumcision, and intend on renewing animal sacrifices in Jerusalem. The film also tried to negate the Jews' heritage with the usual \""fake Jew\"" claim, implying that Jews basically don't have Semitic Israelite ancestry. This is false. First of all, most Israelis are Sephardic and Mizrahi Middle Eastern Jews, who never left the Mid East and who everyone agrees are Semitic Israelites. As for the Ashkenazi European Jews, most current genetic studies are in consensus that their paternal ancestry is Semitic Middle Eastern while their maternal ancestry is Southern European.

429,0.0,"In his third film as a director, John Krasinski shows real talent as a helmer. He has a good eye for visuals, deft handling of pace and timing and a writer's understanding of structure (JK has a degree in writing). This results in often pleasingly beautiful imagery - never a bad thing in the horror genre - and a handful of very good thriller scenes, indeed. A Quiet Place could have been made by Shyamalan or Mel Gibson - whom the bearded Krasinski eerily resembles.But, it's not necessarily a good thing that your work can be mistaken for someone else's. Worse still is if your movie doesn't make sense and breaks its own rules.The premise: creatures appear, who are indestructible, ruthless, blind and are attracted by sound. Even New York is in lockdown. Horror. Krasinski's country family literally lives the quiet life on a farm somewhere, meticulously avoiding making noise. Infuriatingly, this hasn't stopped Krasinski from knocking up his wife (played by JK's real wife, Emily Blunt, in the best performance of the film). It makes for a great horror premise, but very little sense. To be mean: apparently abortion - or contraception - is a big no-no for this Christian family (who prays together) even under this unimaginable threat.A Quiet Place speaks (...) for conservative, family-centered values, which is fine. Whatever. But it really shows its true colors during the final moments, where the real redemption is once again achieved via guns. Which is contradictory to the basic premise of the movie. It feels like a rug pulled from under your feet.In the end, A Quiet Place is conservative also in execution. Krasinski opts for tear-jerking sentimentalism, when he had in his hands the ingredients for a really scary horror movie.

430,0.0,"I usually can appreciate a slow paced movie. I understand that sometimes they want you to see the nuances of the relationships or the character development. But usually there's some kind of pay off at the end.\nThis movie felt very anticlimactic, most likely due to the fact that almost everything that unfolds is in the trailer. Okay there are a few secrets that come out during the police interrogation scenes, but otherwise, it all unfolds the same way as in the trailer.\nThe problem is that it unfolds veeeeeryyyy sloooowwwly, and there are many redundant and repetitive scenes. The director wanted to show the relationships, and some of the struggles the working members of the family were dealing with, but it just feels way too drawn out. Especially the time between them discovering the girl was on the news, to when they are finally caught.

I feel like this was trying to be a god father influenced film, considering the subject matter and tone (Lack there of), since none of this was achieved it barely comes across as a made for TV movie. Self promotion is an understatement. Both writing, directing and acting, D'Angelo fails in all aspects. I think that this film could have been enjoyably bad. While 'The Room' or 'Battlefield earth' had laughably, questionable concepts, this film lacks the capacity to even be ironically funny. The positive reviews aren't genuine!

480,0.0,"Fantastic Four. A more gritty realistic reboot. The film has a fresh new atmosphere to it, almost as fresh as Batman: The Dark Knight did. But I would not compare story and characters to that. Just how it doesn't feel like a typical superhero film.Director Josh Trank successfully builds a new atmosphere and feel for a superhero film. You instantly know the characters, and feel compelled in their journey to success. This is much more of a science fiction thriller than a superhero film though. Do not go in expecting the typical multiple fight scenes, as this film keeps its pace and does not feel rushed. That is, except for the climax of the film, which at a point you suddenly realise this is the climax, and you are near the end. There is a lot of great build up, but ends rather suddenly. But once you get to the point where you realise it is the climax, you will accept it, as it is still thrilling.The movie actually deals with their powers as almost disabilities, disfigurements. They don't achieve their powers and then are like \""oh woo, I'm going to help people and stop the bad guy\"". They are actually scared of their 'powers' to start with, and it is disturbing. You feel it too as you watch it, and that is great. I haven't seen a superhero before which successfully pulled this off. The characters confused at their new abilities. I hope Marvel don't one day buy the rights back and reboot it for their Marvel Cinematic Universe.

504,0.0,"First let me start out by saying I am not a tween, far from a teen and definitely not a Twi-mom but I am a fan, I guess. I read the books some time ago although I never had any interest in Twilight and even less ambition to read four books about sparkling Vampires that call themselves vegetarians although they in deed kill animals\u0085and animals at that, which are close to extinction. But let me not get started on all of that. The story has been dissected by many successfully and yet everyone who had anything to do with the franchise laughs all the way to the bank. I have read quite a few negative reviews here which go on an on about how horrible the storyline is...there are pages and pages which list remarkable conclusions about how obsessive Edward is in some aspects and yet when Bella kisses Jacob, he can't even bring himself to be angry at the girl nor the wolf. It is true, some of it doesn't make any sense and yet no one stops to think that we are watching a film about Vampires and Werewolves living amongst humans in Washington of all places...oh and they attend high school over and over again for the past 100 years or so. None of it makes sense and none of it is real, so by what standards should we criticize here? I find it absolutely incredible that no one mentions how ridiculous it may be that in 'Alice in Wonderland' a girl is every size and then some...she meets talking rabbits and ends up in a teapot and on the rim of a hat right before she yet again towers over everyone and befriends the evil Queen. In the Wizard of Oz, no one said: \""she had to clip t her heels, and that's it?\"" No one questions how Dorothy can be so neat looking after surviving a Tornado...must I go on? The story is the story...is the story! I read the books, all of them, twice, and I loved them. I truly admire Stephenie Mayer for her ability to tell a story; although I still have the feeling that not all the books were her sole creation\u0085we will never know for sure ;) The movies however seem to get worse as they multiply, with the first being the best. I rate this in part on my ability to stay interested and focused while watching. I like the love story; the idea of never ending love that's dangerous and yet so appealing. My husband, who was dragged to the theater by me, liked Eclipse better than the other 2 movies. Surely this has something to do with the battle scenes and the fact that there were actually supposed bad Vampires. In his opinion Vampires are demons who live from blood, human blood, -period. And they are supposed to catch on fire or blow up in sunlight. They aren't supposed to have any concern for human life\u0085and surely not call upon a Werewolf for help. He also asked why Bella and Edward had to hang out in the meadow so much\u0085 \""doesn't he have super human speed and could take her anywhere,\"" he'd asked. But my husband didn't read the books nor would he ever want to. I honestly believe that too many changes have been made to each film, starting with the director and the crew. The hair alone is absolutely hideous and has anyone noticed how much Nikki Reed has changed? I am truly unsure if she had work done or if she just lost so very much weight that she now looks completely different.

519,0.0,"I wanted to cry at the end of this, not because I felt like I had learned anything new, but because it reinforced what I already knew - that sexism is on the rise, especially in young women. The only people that come away from this and feel like their opinion is changed, are people that were influenced by sexist beliefs in the first place. Personally, I had not identified as feminist until recently, but it turns out, I have always been for gender equality. But, because of the labeling of older feminists as \""radical feminists\"", I had felt that that was an insult, and did not want to be considered disagreeable. Younger people now do not understand that \""radical feminist\"" is not a new insult. That was what killed the movement in the 1980s when the ERA failed to pass, which is now only having a new wave due to current politics. Men's rights are not a backlash to feminism - they are hijacking it. It is an inside job. The last argument focuses on circumcision, but what the narrator doesn't seem to understand is that it was the same people in the 1970s that fought for sexual and racial equality, that also fought against things like circumcision. And the women's movement has never claimed that there aren't victims and perpetrators on both sides - that is the opposite of what it claims, since it posits that men and women are equal (and therefore equally capable of being good and bad). While thought provoking, I find that this documentary impassions where feminists already had compassion. The fact that the filmmaker didn't know about these issues is what really terrifies me.Women WANT to dig ditches, we WANT to fight and die in wars. We don't want to be the first person off the boat. And we certainly don't want to coddle men's emotions, just as we don't want women to be coddled. But, you will find that while some men are saying that women have it better than men, they are predominately the same people fighting to keep things the way they are (while not necessarily the men in this film). I think what we see here is an example of men taking their own individual experiences, in which they were negatively effected by a woman or sexism in general, and they are incorrectly extrapolating it to mean that feminism overall is bad.The fact that it does not address benevolent sexism is also troubling (when men treat women as if they are in need of protection). In other words, it focuses on the plight of men suffering for the sacrifice of protecting women, but it fails to expand on why that mentality is bad for women, too (it weakens their social power outside of the context of war and labor, which justifies inequality). Men who demonstrate benevolent sexism are also more likely to demonstrate hostile sexism - the type that we are familiar with, because the two things are related. Those of us who truly understand what sexism is, have always known that the pedestal which women are placed on is in fact imaginary, and men choose to continue making sacrifices (like fighting in wars), because it reinforces their superiority as humans.Real feminists want the opportunity to die for a cause - they want to be able to say they earned their privilege. Because the driving force of human behavior is to do something good for others and to have value in society, even as a ditch digger. It is a privilege to say that you are the breadwinner, and that you did the work. Anti-feminists, like the woman in this film, fail to acknowledge that unfair privilege is harmful to men, by treating them as inferior in a way, needing an unfair advantage, and to be lied to about their true value. The fact that the girls kidnapped by Boko Haram was so publicized is also an example of benevolent sexism, where significant attention was given because of the underlying belief that women are more vulnerable and needing protection. THAT is sexism, not the fact that so many boys were killed, too, which is of course a grave tragedy, and no true feminist would ever say that it wasn't. So, instead of abandoning the idea of feminism as sexual equality for all, why not just acknowledge that you never truly understood it to begin with?","['sexism is on the rise, especially in young women, says nicolaus mills. mills: young people do not understand that ""radical feminist"" is not a new insult. he says men\'s rights are hijacking feminism - it\'s an inside job.']","['i wanted to cry at the end of this, not because i was like i had learned anything new, but because it reinforced what i already knew - this sexism is on the rise, especially in young women. the only people that come away from this and feel like their opinion is changed, first place. personally, i had not identified as feminist until recently, but as turns out, i felt always been for gender equality. but, because of the labeling of older feminists as \\ "" radical feminists \\ "", i had felt that that was an insult, and did not want to be considered disagreeable. younger people now don\'t understand that \\ "" radical feminist \\ "" is not a new insult. that was what killed the movement in the 1980s when the era failed to pass, which is now only having a new wave due to current politics. men\'s rights are not a backlash to feminism - they are hijacking it. it plays an inside job. the last argument focuses on circumcision, but what the narrator doesn\'t seem to understand is that it was the same people in the 1970s that fought for sexual and racial equality, that also fought against things like circumcision. and the women\'s movement has never claimed that there aren\'triiodothyronine victims and perpetrators on both sides - that are the opposite of what it claims, since it posits that men and women are equal ( and therefore equally capable of being good and innocent ). while mood provoking, i find that this documentary impassions where feminists already had compassion. the fact that the filmmaker didn\'t know about these issues is what really terrifies me. women want to dig ditches, we want to defend and die in wars. we don\'t want to be the first person off the boat. and we certainly don\'t want to coddle men\'s emotions, just as we don\'t want women to personify coddled. but, you will find that while some men are saying that women have it better than men, they are never the same the great unwashed fighting to keep things the manner they are ( while not necessarily the men in this film ). i think what we see here is an example of men taking their own individual experiences, in which they became negatively effected by a woman or sexism in general, and they are incorrectly extrapolating it to mean that feminism overall is bad. the fact that it does not address benevolent sexism is also troubling ( when men treat women as if they are in need of protection ). in other words, it focuses on the plight of men suffering for the sacrifice of protecting women, but it fails to expand on why that mentality is bad for women, too ( it weakens their social power outside of the context of war and labor, which justifies inequality ). men who demonstrate benevolent sexism be also more likely to demonstrate hostile sexism - the type that we are familiar with, because the two things are related. those of us who truly understand what sexism is, have always known that the pedestal which women are placed on is in fact imaginary, and man choose to continue making sacrifices ( like fighting in wars ), because it reinforces their superiority as humans. real feminists want the opportunity to die for a cause - they want to be able to say they earned their privilege. because the driving force of human behavior is to do something good for others and to have value in society, even as a ditch digger. it is a privilege to say that you are the breadwinner, and that you did the work. anti - feminists, like the woman in this film, fail to acknowledge that unfair privilege is harmful to men, by treating them as inferior in a way, needing an unfair advantage, and to be lied to about their true value. the fact that the girls kidnapped by boko haram was so publicized is also an example of benevolent sexism, where significant attention was given because of the underlying belief that women are more vulnerable and needing protection. that is sexism, not the fact that so many boys were killed, too, which is of course a grave tragedy, and no true feminist would ever say that it wasn\'t. so, instead of abandoning the idea of feminism as sexual equality for all, why not scarce acknowledge that you never truly understood it to begin with?']"

A child: for me the emblematic symbol for these and all the other 'bal-kan-years'. A Bosnian woman shared with Ms Jolie her experience. This transformed to a love story - changed to a script for a movie, co-producing with own money and shot in 42 days with a cast of real life survivors from the former Yugoslavia.

Awaylooking. The Muslim painter Ajla and the Christian Serbian police Daniel are more than 'Stockholm Syndrome' victims. Details of an evil environment, staging violence for the nothing-doing-audience. In the center the mid-level commander for an internment camp for women and son of a Serbian general, caught by his own history. It started 1992, four months ago: the painter Ajla, working on a picture and babysitting her sisters baby, leaving for an evening at a local nightclub. Encounters Danijel. Then the bomb: and their flirt and to-be-love explodes. The roundup by Serbs, killing the men and taking the women to the internment camp; in charge the Christian Serbian police Danijel. Discovers Ajla among the woman, taking care of her as secret protector, encouraging to escape. Ajla reunites with her sister, part of the rebel forces, planing a counterattack. Captured again.

A lesson what love is when love does not reach beyond the lovers whisper: \""It's a shame you weren't born a Serb.\"" Their relation is a The Nightporter relation: do anything to survive and wait for the moment of freedom.

She knows for sure that he has not the courage to stop his father and the soldiers idea of the cooking-of-a-child-to-death. Ms Jolie highlights with her script and movie the Bosnian War trauma.

560,0.0,"Historical and even scientific truth can be merely the consensus agreed upon by those who presently have the power and influence to determine public opinion, or it can be based on evidence that has been tested in the laboratory, in debate, or in a court of law. Written by David Hare and based on the book \""History on Trial: My Day in Court with David Irving\"" by Professor Deborah Lipstadt of Emory University in Atlanta, Mick Jackson's Denial is an examination of Professor Lipstadt's (Rachel Weisz, \""The Light Between Oceans\"") court battle in London to defend herself from a libel charge brought by British historian David Irving (Timothy Spall, \""Mr. Turner\""), a Holocaust denier and alleged anti-Semite. For all intents and purposes, it is a trial to determine whether or not the Holocaust was real.Denial opens with Professor Lipstadt delivering a talk promoting her book to a roomful of students. One of the people in attendance is David Irving and some friends who are videotaping the lecture. Believing that the gas chambers were used only to destroy lice and that Hitler did not order the genocide of millions of Jews, he disrupts the talk by shouting that he will give one thousand dollars to anyone who can prove that Hitler gave the order to kill the Jews. Refusing to engage with the overwrought Irving, the confrontation ends when Irving is escorted out of the room by security, but it does not end there. In 1996, Irving sued Lipstadt and her British publisher, Penguin Books, in a London court, alleging they were part of an organized movement to destroy his reputation as a historian. The film dramatizes the case using actual testimony based on court records but must be very selective in attempting to condense a trial that lasted four years into a less than two-hour film. Lipstadt soon learns that, under the British system, the burden of proof is not on the accuser but on the accused. Put simply, Lipstadt must prove that what she said about him in her book was true and that not only that he lied about the Holocaust but that it was intentional. While Irving acts as his own counsel, Lipstadt assembles a team of skillful lawyers including the soft-spoken solicitor Anthony Julius (Andrew Scott, \""Alice Through the Looking Glass\"") who represented Princess Diana in divorce proceedings and barrister Richard Rampton (Tom Wilkinson, \""Snowden\""), a man of quiet strength. Tension develops early between the defendant and her team when, on a fact-finding visit to Auschwitz-Birkenau, Lipstadt accuses Rampton of being clinical and unemotional about what happened there, a charge to which he takes umbrage. Conflict also surfaces when Rampton and Julius decide that neither Lipstadt nor any Holocaust survivors will be put on the stand in order to keep the focus on Irving's credibility and not give him the opportunity to badger or humiliate the witness. When Lipstadt argues that it is her right \""to stand up against someone who wants to pervert the truth,\"" Rampton tells her that \""these things are happening to you, but the case is not about you.\""One of the trial's pivotal moments occurs when Rampton proves that Irving manipulated the call logs of Nazi Heinrich Himmler to hide Hitler's role in the killing of the Jews, an occurrence that Irving calls a mistake. Rampton also produces a 1991 video in which Irving is heard to say, \""I say quite tastelessly in fact that more women died on the back seat of Edward Kennedy's car at Chappaquiddick than ever died in a gas chamber in Auschwitz.\"" Ultimately, Judge Charles Gray (Alex Jennings, \""The Lady in the Van\"") must decide on the merits of Irving's libel suit, knowing that his decision will have reverberations far beyond this one court trial. Denial is an important film on a subject that needs to be discussed, yet the film, unfortunately comes too close to one-dimensional hero making rather than concentrating on its key message, the necessity of separating fact from fiction, and fantasy from reality when it comes to historical events. While the performances are strong, especially those of Spall and Wilkinson, the characters are more symbolic than real and unnecessary subplots only muddy the waters. While the film correctly debunks the distortion of history in the pursuit of a political agenda, it is important to keep the issue in perspective. Deflating conspiracy theories should not be a tool used by the powerful to stifle dissent and marginalize those with minority opinions. Each theory or different interpretations of fact should be judged on one measure alone \u2013 whether or not there is sufficient evidence to support it. Denial chronicles one theory that was examined and found to be baseless and the world will be forever grateful.","[""denial is an examination of Professor Lipstadt's court battle to defend herself from a libel charge. under the British system, the burden of proof is not on the accuser but on the accused. the film's performances are strong, especially those of Spall and Wilkinson.""]","['historical and even scientific truth can be merely the consensus agreed upon by those who presently have the power and influence to determine public opinion, or it can be based on evidence that has been tested in the laboratory, in debate, or in a court of law. written by david hare again based on the book \\ "" history on trial : my day in court with david irving \\ "" by professor deborah lipstadt of emory university in atlanta, mick jackson\'s denial is an examination of professor lipstadt\'n ( der weisz, \\ "" the light between oceans \\ "" ) court battle in london to defend herself from a libel charge brought by british historian david irving ( timothy spall, \\ "" mr. turner \\ "" ), a holocaust denier and alleged anti -

564,0.0,"5 friends go up to a cabin in the woods to help one of them detox from some drugs. Going cold turkey proves to be more difficult when the uncover an ancient book of the dead, which is bound in human flesh and inked in human blood. When one reads from the pages, it unleashes an evil so grotesque and profound that nothing can stop it. Of course, someone reads from it....Let me tell you where this review is coming from. I LOVE the original to death, it's my favourite horror film of all time. I've seen the red band trailer and I read the script, so I knew exactly what was going to happen. Did that hinder my enjoyment of the film? A bit, knowing some twists in the narrative makes the film lose some freshness, but I don't think the decision to stay true to the script was not all that great a choice. The film is a flawed attempt from people who love the source material. I can still give this remake a passing grade.Where the film excels is the most obvious point I or anyone else will make in their reviews. The practical effects, mainly the gore. With only a few noticeable scenes in CGI blood, this film decides to use the gore that most horror fans are use to. It looks real, feels real and is actually refreshing to see. People were sad about the news of an Evil Dead remake until the RedBand trailer came out and they saw the carnage on screen. Most of the 'shocking' gore bits are in the trailer (tongue slice, face saw, arm cut, etc) So I don't think there will be a lot of surprises here, but they excel at presenting it in such an over the top, yet serious fashion. The film looks great with some nice camera movements that add to the unsettling atmosphere. Once the crap hits the fan, it's a no holds barred blood fest. This remake plays it straight, offering little to no camp that can be found in the original series. There are obvious winks and nods to the original, involving chainsaws, hands and tweaked famous lines, but for the most part this entry tries to separate itself from the original. This is where it succeeds and fails in my opinion. The reason they are there is a nice little way of keeping them there. One character has to detox from drugs, so obviously she will be the first one who senses something is wrong here but no one will believe her cause she's coming down from the drugs. This is the little bit of character background they try to squeeze in. This film is not concerned so much with character backstories, yet they try to present some to the audience. It makes for an odd and slow build up for the carnage. When it hits, we don't care about any of them either. I even forgot that the girlfriend was there because she disappears for most of the first act only to show up for her own gruesome scene.The film is not scary at all. I was terrified of the original, this one didn't even have me jump at those cheap jump scares. I was scared of the cellar in Raimi's version. Here I think it is just gross. That's the main theme the film wants to get across it seems. It wants to gross you out, not terrify you, not make you smile, not make you care about anyone, just make you squirm at the blood. I have to give the film props for at least trying to separate itself from the original by making the story a bit of its own thing. Whether or not this works is another story. The one giant misstep, in my opinion, is when they try to make the evil and actual thing. The book reads that HE is coming, HE wants your soul, etc. The evil should not be characterized by a single demonic entity. I always envisioned the evil dead as multiple dead scary things. This is one direction that the film takes to separate itself, it fails in that aspect. Finally, the climax of the film. There is one scene just before the climax, I have to add, which is mind boggling dumb. I was rolling my eyes reading the script and had hopes they would change it, they don't. Never before has the evil been so easily defeated and never more have I been so disappointed at a story choice. After that we get a bit of a character shift and the climax is a bloody mess. Again, this chase sequence feels less Evil Dead and more Friday the 13th stalker-ish. While it is thrilling to watch and ending with a bang, it feels out of place. This Evil Dead is gruesome, but some fun is to be had. A flawed remake that could have been so much worse. For those interested, there is a little after the credits bit that, even though feels half-assed, is a nice fan service moment.","[""this remake of the original to death is a flawed attempt from people who love the source material. the chase sequence feels less Friday the 13th stalker-ish than the original. it's thrilling to watch and ending with a bang, but it feels out of place.""]","[""5 friends go up to a cabin in the woods to help one of them detox from some drugs. going cold turkey proves to be more difficult when the uncover an ancient book of the dead, which is bound in human flesh and inked in human blood. when one looks from the pages, information technology delivers an evil so grotesque and profound that nothing can stop it. of course, someone reads from it.... let somewhere tell you where this review is coming from. i love the original to death, it's my favourite horror film of all time. i've seen the red band trailer and i read the script, so i knew exactly what was going to happen. did that hinder my enjoyment making the film? a bit, knowing some twists in the narrative makes the film lose some freshness, but i don't think the decision to stay true to the script was not all that great a choice. the ending is a flawed attempt from people who love the source material. i can still give this remake a passing grade. where the film excels is the most obvious distinction i or anyone else will make in their reviews. the practical effects, mainly the gore. with only a few noticeable scenes in cgi blood, this film decides to use the gore that most western fans are use to. it looks real, feels real and is actually refreshing to see. people were sad about the news of an evil dead remake until the redband trailer came out and they saw the carnage on screen. most of the'shocking'gore bits are in the trailer ( tongue slice, face saw, arm cut, etc ) so i don't think there will be a lot of surprises here, but they excel at presenting it in quite an terminated the top, yet serious fashion. the film looks great with some nice camera movements that add to the unsettling atmosphere. once the crap hits the fan, it's a no holds barred blood fest. this remake plays information technology straight, offering little to no camp that can be found in the original series. there are obvious winks and nods to the original, involving chainsaws, hands and tweaked famous lines, but for the some part this entry tries to separate itself from the original. this is where nothing succeeds and fails in my opinion. the reason they are there is a nice little means of keeping them there. one character has to detox from drugs, so obviously she will be the first one world health organization senses something is wrong here but no one will believe her cause she's coming down from the drugs. this is the little bit of character background they try to squeeze in. this film is not concerned so much with character backstories, yet they try to present some to the audience. it make for an odd and slow build up for the carnage. when it hits, we don't care about any of them either. i even forgot that the girlfriend was there because she disappears for most of the first act only to show up for her own gruesome scene. the film be not scary at all. i was terrified of the original, this one didn't even have me jump at those cheap jump scares. i was scared of the cellar in raimi's version. here i think it is just gross. that's the main theme the film wants to get across it seems. it wants to gross you out, not terrify you, not make you smile, not make you care about anyone, just make you squirm at the blood. i have to give the film props for at least trying to separate itself from the original by making the story a bit of its own thing. whether or not this works is another story. the one giant misstep, in my opinion, is when they try to make the evil and actual thing. the book reads that he is coming, he wants your soul, etc. the evil should not be characterized by a single demonic entity. i always envisioned the evil dead as multiple dead scary things. this is one direction that the film takes to separate itself, it fails in that aspect. finally, the climax of the film. there is one scene just before the climax, i have to add, which is mind boggling and had hopes they would change it, they don't. never before has the evil been so easily defeated and never more have i been so disappointed at a story choice. after that we get a bit of a character shift and the climax is a bloody mess. again, this chase sequence feels less evil dead and more friday the 13th stalker - ish. while it is thrilling to watch and ending with a bang, it feels out of place. this evil dead is gruesome, but some fun is to be had. a flawed remake that could have been so much worse. for those interested, there is a little after the credits bit that, even though feels half - assed, is a nice fan service moment.""]"

This movie is a rip of Romeo and Juliet, it contains the boy who is considered to be in the lower class while the women is a high class person. As the story goes on we get crappy flashbacks from the past to the present and hear an old lady explaining her true love. And to make it worse the movie is 3 hours and 19 minutes long making every second of the movie even more painful. When i first watched this movie at home i checked my watch every other second and got tired of the storyline and skipped scenes. In my opinion it would be just easier to cut the movie down to 2 hours and 10 minutes instead, but then again this is James Cameron. Known for making long movies and crappy story lines. He should of just skipped this project and focused more on the Terminator or Alien instead, at least those films have action to keep the movie moving.

I have no problem with the plot design - it's well assembled and effectively climaxed. Overall, a well thought out entertaining film. The dialogue and characterisation devices however were cheesy and untrue to the world of the story.1)The new inmates line up for a speech from the warden. One inmate growls: \""When do we eat?\"". Unrealistic and unnecessary. He might well have said: \""Please hit me several times so the audience can see how brutal this prison is.\"" The brutality of the prison is conveyed when crying fat boy gets kicked to death, so this addition is pointless.2)The story had already established freemans and robbins friendship, when freeman leans over to robbins and says: \""We're kinda becomin friends aren't we?\"" Can you ever imagine any grown adult actually saying that to another?3)Worst scene of the film: the music scene. The film uses music to symbolise the theme of hope (robbins mind music in the hole, freemans harmonica). This is first introduced when robbins locks himself in the office and blares loud music all over the prison. Yeah OK, willful main character. But when the warden and guards shout for him to turn it off, what does he do? He sits back with feet up and smug grin plastered on his face. The guards bang again and again. What does he do? He leans over to the gramaphone and turns the volume up. I mean, come on, do me a favour. His punishment is a month in the hole, and for a simple reason.

599,0.0,"Never before have I been tempted to rip off my face and throw it at the TV screen just so I didn't have to watch anymore. Not only was this THE worst Vampire film I have ever seen, but it was also one of the worst films ever. It is quite clearly Vampires for Disney, or rather Vampires for barely pubescent girls. I am actually getting really angry just writing this, for a start forget all the well known Vampire folklore, that goes right out the window. They can walk about in sunlight, crucifixes do nothing, they don't have fangs and they never sleep. They can however run very quickly and also fly without wings. If all that doesn't put you off they don't even kill humans, they just ponce about looking like a load of pasty-faced EMO's (another group the film is clearly aimed at) keeping themselves to themselves. and that is it. for the first hour and a half! then some proper Vampires turn up and they run away, then fight, then run some more, then fight the end. The love story is absolutely pathetic, she's new in town sits next to him in class he seethes, he walks out. she doesn't see him for three weeks, he apologises, saves her from a crash and wham bam they're in love?

621,0.0,"The Concept: 'City of Lost Children' meets 'They Live' meets 'Beauty and the Beast'Spoiler Warning...If there's one good thing the insipid 'Harry Potter' series has done, it's helped marginally raise our understanding of magic.  Lynch tried explaining it with 'Dune'--the best attempt in a sci-fi setting.  None of that understanding is taken into account here, its only a lightshow.I am continuing my study of animation styles and this was one of several anime that I examined (the others being 'Vampire Hunter D', 'Akira', 'Golgo 13', and 'Mononoke Hime').  I noticed one consistent theme: the art styles are all the same.  Characters suffer from 'Pokemon' design.  One motif is interesting: giant, amorphous blobs.Here in America I've found at least four styles--the exaggeration method of Disney &amp; Bluth, the CGI teams, the TV method of 'Heavy Metal' and its ilk, and the reality obsession of Bakshi.  It's taken us 80 years to reach this point.  Will the Japanese catch up?What really frustrates is the scant material in anime stories.  If a story leaves enough open ends for me to create another interpretation, I've just found my entertainment.  Example: 'Falling Down' is really a dream by Michael Douglas in the midst of a traffic jam.  Duvall is just a mental extension of himself that shoots him in the end.  Layman's terms: Douglas dreams of rampage, stalking and killing himself.  How good is that?We get no such opportunities here.  This isn't even 'Alice.'  Alice was about wordplay, integration of reality into fantasy, and surrealism.  Here we get some simple surrealism and nothing else, even the protagonist is sexless.The most interesting part is that Disney and Pixar managed the American release.  Since Disney's conventional team has quit, they are taking stock in anime in order to ride the popularity wave.

666,0.0,"Oldboy, the Korean film so beloved of Tarantino has become something of a word of mouth cult film in the UK lately. As a film student myself, I've heard plenty of talk in seminars among other people on my course about this incredible movie that simply has to be seen but I wasn't swayed into watching it immediately because of one thing; it is director Chan-wook Park's follow up to Sympathy For Mr Vengeance. That previous film, while decent enough went on far too long and the end payoff was not quite worth it, yet despite this it was hyped to the heavens. So, settling down to watch Oldboy, I was a tad wary of the hype machine blinding viewers to the limitations of an otherwise unspectacular film.Like Sympathy...Oldboy is another film concerned with the theme of revenge but on a first glance, seems a little more straightforward in it's approach. A man named Oh Dae-Su has been imprisoned in a room for 15 years and when released, sets about hunting down the people who did this to him and taking his revenge. On the surface, this seems like a simple revenge fantasy, but as the mystery of why he was subjected to his confinement unfurls, things become a little more complicated. Lee Woo-Jin, his nemesis is at first a cold, calculating man fixated on destroying Dae-Su, but once his reason for doing so becomes clear, its hard not to feel just a little sympathy for him. Furthermore, Park pulls plot twist after plot twist out of his film makers bag of tricks, but manages to keep it from becoming disorientating like in say, Identity and the pace of the film does not suffer for these quiet, analytical sequences.However, what ultimately lets it down is that you get the feeling Park wasn't totally decided on what sort of film to make. Sympathy...for all its flaws had no misgivings about the fact it was a dark revenge tale, but Oldboy cannot seem to decide whether it is a action spectacle or a twisted, Oedipal tragedy. The infamous corridor fight sequence for instance, while fun, seems extremely out of place with the rest of the film and can we really believe that Dae-Su is such a great fighter, when all the training he has done has consisted of shadow boxing? And whoever was in charge of casting needs a grand old kick in the balls, as Dae-Su and Woo-Jin look to have about fifteen years of age difference between them, when they're supposed to be almost the same age.An interesting and diverting film then, but hardly the nugget of cinematic gold that some have made it out to be. Also, be prepared for some rather gruesome moments. In one instance, the lead characters eats a live octopus, in another a man has his teeth snapped out with a hammer and there are numerous cases of torture and violence.","[""a man named Oh Dae-Su has been imprisoned in a room for 15 years. when released, he sets about hunting down the people who did this to him. oldboy is director Chan-wook park's follow up to Sympathy For Mr Vengeance.""]","[""oldboy, the korean film so beloved of me has become something of a word of mouth cult film in the uk lately. as a film student myself, i've heard plenty of talk in seminars among other people on my course about this incredible movie that simply has to be seen but i wasn't swayed into watching it immediately because of one thing ; it is director chan - wook park's follow up to sympathy over mr black. that previous film, while decent enough went on far too long and the end payoff was not quite worth it, yet despite this it was hyped to the heavens. so, settling down to watch oldboy, i was a tad wary of the hype machine blinding viewers to the limitations of an otherwise unspectacular film. like sympathy... oldboy is another film concerned with the theme of revenge but on a first glance, seems a little more straightforward in it's approach. a man named oh yong - su has lai imprisoned in a room for 15 years and when released, sets about hunting down the people who did this to him and taking his revenge. on the surface, this seems like a simple revenge fantasy, but as the mystery of wherefore he was subjected to his confinement unfurls, things become a little more complicated. lee woo - jin, his nemesis be at first a cold, calculating man fixated on arresting dae - su, but once his reason for doing so becomes clear, its hard not to feel just a little sympathy for him. furthermore, park pulls plot twist after plot twist out of his film makers bag of tricks, but manages to keep it from becoming disorientating like in say, identity and the pace of the film does not suffer for these quiet, analytical sequences. however, what ultimately lets it down is that you get the feeling park wasn't totally decided on what sort of film to make. sympathy... for all its flaws had no misgivings about the fact it was a dark revenge tale, since oldboy cannot seem to decide whether it is a action spectacle or a twisted, oedipal tragedy. the infamous corridor fight sequence for instance, while fun, seems extremely out of place with the rest of his film but can we even believe that dae - su is has done has consisted of shadow boxing? and whoever be in charge of casting needs a grand old kick in the balls, as dae - su and woo - jin look to have about fifteen years of age difference between them, when they're supposed to be almost the same age. an interesting and diverting film then, but hardly the nugget of cinematic gold that some have made it out to be. also, be prepared for some rather gruesome moments. in one instance, the lead characters eat a live octopus, in another a man has his teeth snapped out with a hammer and there are numerous cases of torture and violence.""]"

674,0.0,"This movie is a little weird.First weird decision is that the movie starts off with having the viewer read the \""legend\"" that makes up the main premise of the movie - this immediately got a groan from me. If you expect people to read, the movie that comes afterwords has to be amazing to the nth degree. A below-average revenge-porn horror is not that.The second weird decision is making the above-mentioned 'legend' part of the premise - the main character was already a super-soldier lady who almost got away based on her own skills and showed herself more than competent. I can't help but feel that I would have cheered her on a little harder if it had just been her, one-woman'ing it up on her quest for vengeance (not that the possession changes that a huge deal - it's kind of hard to see to which degree she's possessed). Of course, that would have made it even more of a 'Grave' clone. It also didn't help that the 'legend' part was done so badly - Ayiana's costume was horrible and she spoke English when performing her little ritual (extremely jarring).Third weird decision is the pacing - there is pretty much no tension built at any point in the movie. It goes nothing-action-a bit of tension-action-nothing-action. The only real tension seemed to be when main lady was running from the villains after they killed Fianc\u00e9 Guy but even that was quite short - what should have been the main focus, killing the villains, was completely unsatisfying and boring in the end with no tension or variance.On the formal side of things, acting was pretty bad. I didn't believe her, her fianc\u00e9 or the villains for a second. Dialogue was pretty bad - the obnoxious villain sidekick was painful to listen to and all the others were almost as bad. Sound effects were pretty bad - gun shot sounds stand out as particularly mediocre and meh. Visual effects are very meh as well; it's often very obvious that the weapons don't make contact or cut aways are used to avoid using effects.Most egregious of all, though - and absolutely the funniest - is when Fianc\u00e9 Guy talks to his bro over FaceTime. It's a still-image with normal (way too high quality, no options displayed) video imposed on it. That was the moment I knew what kind of movie this would be and I laughed and laughed.About the only things that seemed likable were that the relationship between the lovers was portrayed nicely (if acted somewhat sub-par) - light and humorous - and the strong female lead. She was clearly the one in the relationship associated with more \""masculine\"" traits and the fianc\u00e9 in turn showed some more \""feminine\"" traits which made them seem like more substantial characters instead of the usual cardboard cut outs.In short, if you want rape-revenge horror, go for 'I Spit on Your Grave' - if you want possessed revenge horror, go for 'Savaged'. Neither were high art but both much better than this.","[""'i Spit on Your Grave' is a rape-revenge horror.'savaged' is an possessed revenge horror with a strong female lead. the only real tension seemed to be when main lady was running from the villains after they killed Fiancu00e9 Guy.""]","['this movie is his little weird. first weird decision is that most movie starts off with having the viewer read the \\ "" legend \\ "" that makes up the main premise of the movie - this immediately got a groan from me. if you expect people to read, the movie that comes afterwords has to be amazing to the nth degree. a below - average revenge - porn horror is not that. the 2nd weird decision is making the above - mentioned\'legend\'part of the premise - the main character was already a super - soldier lady who almost go away based on her own skills and showed herself more than competent. i can\'t help but feel that i would have cheered her on a little harder if it had just been her, one - woman\'ing it up on her instinct for vengeance ( not that the possession changes that a huge deal - it\'s form of hard to see to which degree she\'s possessed ). of course, that would have made it even more clearly a\'grave\'film. it also didn\'t help that the\'legend\'part was working so badly - ayiana\'s costume was horrible and she spoke english when performing her little ritual ( extremely jarring ). third weird decision is the pacing - there is pretty much no tension built at any point in the movie. it goes nothing - action - a bit no tension - action - nothing - action. the only real tension seemed to be when main lady was running from the villains after they killed fianc \\ u00e9 guy but even that was quite short - what should have been the main focus, killing the villains, was completely disappointing and boring in the end with no tension or variance. on the formal side of things, acting was pretty bad. i didn\'t believe her, her fianc \\ u00e9 or the villains for a second. dialogue was pretty bad - the obnoxious villain sidekick was painful to listen to and all pretty well - gun shot sound stand out as particularly mediocre and meh. visual effects are very meh as well ; it\'s often very obvious that the weapons don\'t make noise or cut aways are used to avoid using effects. most egregious of all, acting - and absolutely the funniest - is when fianc \\ u00e9 guy talks to his bro over facetime. information technology\'s a still - image with normal ( way too high quality, no options displayed ) video imposed on it. that live the moment i knew what kind of movie this would be and i laughed and laughed. about the only things that seemed likable were that the relationship between the lovers was portrayed nicely ( if acted somewhat sub - par ) - light and humorous - and the strong female lead. she was clearly the one in the relationship associated with more \\ "" masculine \\ "" traits and the fianc \\ u00e9 in turn showed some more \\ "" feminine \\ "" traits which made them seem like more substantial characters instead of the usual cardboard cut outs. in short, if you want rape - revenge horror, go for\'i spit on your grave\'- if you want possessed revenge horror, go for\'savaged \'. neither were high art but both much better than this.']"

678,0.0,"Percy is seen as an anti-Monsanto movie and it should be noted that it can be also seen as a movie that can let viewers form their own opinions about the role of corporates, intellectual property and the also the farmer's rights. The movie has, to an extant some anti GMO rhetoric and this may lead people to be influenced and swayed by the orotundity in the narrative portraying the whole thing as some David and Goliath fight, as it is a small farmer taking on a big international corporate. There is clearly an effort by the director to connect to the common man - the farmer here - at the same time, also to make a broader appeal which in itself is not wrong, only thing is that, some of the facts in the movie is not so correct and a lot of things remains to be explained when we go deep into the case.Some of the important points to note about the law suit according to the court is that - The farmer did not at all explain why he sprayed Roundup to isolate the Roundup Ready plants he found on his land; why he then harvested the plants and segregated the seeds, saved them and kept them for seed; why he next planted them; and why through this husbandry, he ended up with 1,030 acres of Roundup Ready canola.Here are some of my points on the whole issue of the lawsuit with Monsanto - The fact that the farmer can save his/her seeds for the next generation is a right and it is a contentious right at that and there is no dearth of debate on it. GMOs as such is good for the future food safety of the world and they are released for larger cultivation only after all the regulations and such things having been taken care of meticulously by researchers and by the governments to ensure its safety biologically, note that here the socioeconomic aspects of GMO cultivation is a different thing altogether which is a lot more complex as against the biological aspects.The incorporation of terminator technology to make the seeds infertile in the next generation was a method that was intended to be practiced by giant companies to prevent the farmer from using saved seeds. This was one way the Giant corporates could easily prevent the use of seeds saved by the farmer, as the seeds saved would be of no use to him/her is the terminator technology is implemented. This actually is wrong and should not be implemented and was not implemented. Here is some information on that technology which is known as Genetic Use Restriction Technology (GURT), also known as terminator technology. This, if implemented would force farmers, particularly in the developing world to buy seeds from one season to the next. This is effective in grain crops where the progeny of the improved variety, Hybrid or the Genetically modified crops may retain some of genetic makeup of the parent crop - note that the progeny may retain some of the adaptive traits that it was bred for, this may be true in GM crops, not so in hybrids. Also note that most hybrids do not retain the advantageous traits of high yield or pest and disease resistance in the next generation - the yield advantage will slowly keep decreasing as the generation progresses as there will be no genetic uniformity. This technology was opposed and all the Major seed corporation and MNCs have agreed not to use this technology and this has not been commercialized.The movie may not have historical accuracy and some of the facts may have been changed to cash in on the general perception of people who like to view big giant corporations as the farmer's enemy. The movie in my view is not going to change the public perception of GMO which largely is negative, mainly due to media information exactly like the one in this movie. Having said all this - there is one important point - the production of Transgenic plants that will encourage the use of chemicals as the case here in the movie where the farmer uses GMOs which are resistant to herbicide encourages the use of herbicides which in itself is not good. Monsanto produces the Transgenic Canola and also the manufactures the herbicide which can be used on it. Take this case in Soyabean - Herbicide tolerance is not a desirable trait in GM crops, any trait that promotes chemical use is not good. Here is an example - Monsanto releases Glyphosate resistant GM soyabean, Glyphosate use increases and in due course super weeds come up that are resistant to Glyphosate. Now Monsanto releases GM soyabean resistant to two herbicides - both Glyphosate and Dicamba, there is a drift problem in Dicamba and there are restrictions in its use, as it may drift and go to the nearby field and affect the crop that is not resistant, farmers in about 10 states in America are using Dicamba illegally to realize high yield in soyabean. A case has been won against Monsanto on this issue of Dicamba drift. On January 27, 2020, the first ever lawsuit concerning Dicamba-related products began in Missouri. The lawsuit filed in November 2016, involves a peach farmer who alleged that Dicamba based herbicides caused significant damage to his crops and trees. On February 14, 2020, the jury involved in the lawsuit ruled against Monsanto acquisitor Bayer and its co-defendant BASF and found in favor of the peach grower, Bader Farms owner Bill Bader - Source Wiki.The chance that super weeds that are resistant to both Glyphosate and Dicamba can come up due this is also an issue. The lesson from this is, GM crops which encourage chemical use is not good in the long run. Herbicide tolerance has been the dominant trait among transgenic crops till now, it has occupied 45 percent of the global biotech/GM crop area. Herbicide tolerance trait in soybeans, canola, maize, alfalfa, and cotton has been most cultivated. These Transgenics are tolerant to glyphosate, glufosinate, and dicamba. Herbicide tolerance deployed in soybean, maize, canola, cotton, sugar beet, and alfalfa occupied 88.7 million hectares or 47 percent of the 189.8 million hectares of biotech crops planted globally. There are three points here which should be understood - GM crops that are tolerant to herbicides is not a good idea as it increases the use of the chemicals. GM crops that are resistant to insects and diseases are needed, as it reduces the use of chemicals. There is a catch here, as the status of resistance to insects and pests by these GM crops can change, as insects can evolve new mechanisms by which they can overcome this resistance in GM crops. This is not the case in GM crops that are tolerant to abiotic stress like - drought, salinity - which have no biotic component - so GM crops with abiotic stress tolerance it is much safer.The take away from the movie is that, to an extant the laws have to be formulated so that farmer is benefited and at the same time we should understand that big corporates are motivated by profit and they invest a lot of time and money in GM technology and it is only natural that they look for gain. The other important point, like I have explained is that, not all GM is the same, most are good and some that encourage the use of chemicals is not good.","[""the movie percy is seen as an anti-Monsanto movie and it can be seen as a movie that can let viewers form their own opinions about the role of corporates, intellectual property and the also the farmer's rights. there is clearly an effort by the director to connect to the common man - the farmer here - at the same time as making a broader appeal. the movie may not have historical accuracy and some of the facts in the movie is not so correct.""]","[""percy is seen as an anti - monsanto movie and it should be noted that it can be also seen as a movie that can let viewers form their own opinions about the role in corporates, intellectual property and the also the fannie farmer's rights. the movie has, to an extent some anti gmo rhetoric and this may lead citizenry to be influenced and swayed by the orotundity in the narrative portraying the whole thing as some david and goliath fight, as it is a humble case taking on a big international corporate. there is clearly an effort by the managing investor to connect to the common man - the farmer here - at the same time, also to make a broader appeal which in itself is not wrong, only thing is that, some of the facts in the movie is not so correct and a lot of things remains to be explained when we go deep into the case. some of the important points to note about the law suit according to the court is that - the farmer did not at all explain why he sprayed roundup to isolate the roundup ready plants he found on his property ; why he then harvested the plants and segregated the seeds, saved them and kept them for seed ; why he next planted them ; and why through this husbandry, he ended up with 1, 030 acres with roundup ready canola. here are some of my points on the whole issue of the lawsuit with monsanto - the fact that the farmer can save his / her seeds for the next generation is a right and it gets a contentious right at that and there is no dearth of debate on it. gmos as such is good for the future food safety of this world and they are released for larger cultivation only after all the regulations and such things having been taken care of meticulously by researchers and by the governments to ensure its safety biologically, note that here the socioeconomic aspects of gmo cultivation is a different thing altogether which is a lot more complex as against the biological aspects. the incorporation of terminator technology to make the seeds infertile in the next generation was a method that was intended to be practiced by giant companies to prevent the farmer from using saved seeds. this was one way the giant corporates could easily prevent the use of seeds saved by the farmer, as the seeds saved would be of no use before him / her is the terminator technology is implemented. that actually is wrong and should not be implemented and was not implemented. here is some information on that technology which is known as genetic use restriction technology ( gurt ), also known as terminator technology. this, if implemented would force farmers, particularly in the developing world to buy seeds from one season to the next. this is effective in grain crops where the progeny of the improved variety, hybrid or the genetically modified crops may retain some of genetic makeup of the parent crop - note that the progeny may retain some of the adaptive traits that it be bred for, this may be true in gm crops, not so in hybrids. also note that most hybrids don't retain the advantageous traits of high yield or pest and disease resistance in the next generation - the yield advantage will slowly keep decreasing as the generation build as there will be no genetic uniformity. this technology was opposed and all the major seed corporation and mncs have agreed not to use this technology and this take not been commercialized. the movie may not have historical accuracy and some of the facts may have been changed to cash in on the general perception of people who like to view big giant corporations as the farmer's enemy. the movie in my view is not going to change the public perception of gmo which largely is negative, mainly due to medium information exactly like the one in this movie. having said all this - there is one important point - the production of transgenic plants that will encourage the use of chemicals as the case here in the movie where the farmer uses gmos which are resistant to herbicide encourages the use of herbicides which in itself is not good. monsanto produces the transgenic canola and also the manufactures the herbicide which can be used on it. take this case in soyabean - herbicide tolerance is not a desirable trait in gm crops, any trait that promotes chemical use is not good. here is an example - monsanto releases glyphosate resistant gm soyabean, glyphosate use increases and in due course super weeds come up that are resistant to glyphosate. now monsanto releases gm soyabean resistant to two herbicides - both glyphosate and dicamba, there is a drift problem in dicamba and there are restrictions in its use, as it may drift and go to the nearby field and affect 10 states in america are using dicamba illegally to realize high yield in soyabean. a case has been won against monsanto on this issue of dicamba drift. on january 27, 2020, the first ever lawsuit concerning dicamba - related products began in missouri. the lawsuit filed in november 2016, involves a peach farmer who alleged that dicamba based herbicides caused significant damage to his crops and trees. on february 14, 2020, the jury involved in the lawsuit ruled against monsanto acquisitor bayer and its co - defendant basf and found in favor of the peach grower, bader farms owner bill bader - source wiki. the chance that super weeds that are resistant to both glyphosate and dicamba can come up due this is also an issue. the lesson from this is, gm crops which encourage chemical use is not good in the long run. herbicide tolerance has been the dominant trait among transgenic crops till now, it has occupied 45 percent of the global biotech / gm crop area. herbicide tolerance trait in soybeans, canola, maize, alfalfa, and cotton has been most cultivated. these transgenics are tolerant to glyphosate, glufosinate, and dicamba. herbicide tolerance deployed in soybean, maize, canola, cotton, sugar beet, and alfalfa occupied 88. 7 million hectares or 47 percent of the 189. 8 million hectares of biotech crops planted globally. there are three points here which should be understood - gm crops that are tolerant to herbicides is not a good idea as it increases the use of the chemicals. gm crops that are resistant to insects and diseases are needed, as it reduces the use of chemicals. there is a catch here, as the status of resistance to insects and pests by these gm crops can change, as insects can evolve new mechanisms by which they can overcome this resistance in gm crops. this is not the case in gm crops that are tolerant to abiotic stress like - drought, salinity - which have no biotic component - so gm crops with abiotic stress tolerance it is much safer. the take away from the movie be that, to an extant the laws have to be formulated so that farmer is benefited and at the same time we should understand that big corporates are motivated by profit and they invest a lot of time and money in gm technology and it is only natural that they look for gain. the other important point, like i have explained is that, not all gm is the same, most are good and some that encourage the use of chemicals is not good.""]"

685,0.0,"* YES, IT DOES CONTAIN A FEW SPOILERSSpirited Away is a story about Chihiro, a smart young girl who - thanks to her parents stupidity -  end up getting lost in a sacred forbidden city where spirits come to bath and relax. But you already knew that before reading.I can tell you up front that the story is pretty much a copycat version of Alice in Wonderland, only with a much darker plot. For example, in the preview you don't get to see Chhiro's parents mutating into pigs after eating the forbidden food there. Nor is the fact mentioned that the guy who turns into a dragon does so because he sold his life to witchcraft. Or is even mentioned that part of the scary old women's pets is three decapitated heads rolling and jumping around. So think twice, about it if you want to bring kids to this movie ( then again Disney probably cut all that out, or adlibed it differently to change the story). My little cousin, from what I hear ran out of the theatre scared as hell... but then went back in later on because he was curious to see how it would end.\nSo how about good points?. Well, I can tell you that the animation is superb. I mean really good. It's a mileu - where you get to wonder in awe of the scenery , rather than concentrate on the story. The music is also very well orchestrated, giving a great overall feel to the movie.\nNow the bad points. The plot stinks. I mean it, there are literally so many holes and details that if you're not paying attention to the whole thing, you'll get confused very soon. The question, as to whether or not Chirhio is able save her parents is pretty obvious and as to why you would care is another question that never gets answered. Overall, after seeing the movie you'll feel it's pretty pointless.  Oh yes, and they also dubbed it - another bad thing. I can tell by watching the preview that the dialogue has changed. I watched the chinese version - and there is a difference. So , should things not make sense , just blame the translators.So what's my judgement?  YES - go and see it.

711,0.0,"I'd have to somewhat agree with those who think that this is more or  less Angelina Jolie's very own Schindler's List and there's a bit of  Romeo &amp; Juliet element to it as well, and just like the Shakespearean  classic itself, this too is a tragedy. Quite ambitious and daring for a  feature directorial debut but I wasn't completely surprised because  this film came from an Oscar winning actress whose humanitarian work,  especially for this region, has been very passionate. Jolie's future as  a filmmaker looks promising..  Jolie doesn't hold back in her effort to show how brutal the Bosnian  war was. The environment looks authentic and harsh. And just like  Spielberg's 1993 Oscar winning film, IN THE LAND OF BLOOD AND HONEY  also invests most of its time going into details about the killings and  the disregard for human life. The raping scenes would be uncomfortable  for some to watch. I remember I attended the press screening, it was  already a few minutes into the movie and at the door there was a person  who I thought at first was the studio's rep but then she told me she  was a fellow press member and she was there just to wait until the rape  scene ended so she could then re-enter the room and watch the rest of  the film. Some may argue that this is a one sided story, everybody is  entitled to their opinion, if this was indeed a movie that's pro  Bosnian Muslim or pro Serb, I wouldn't be able to tell because what I  saw was both sides killing each other and none of them was the better.  I think Jolie is just angry at the fact that the international  community did not intervene in time to stop the genocide or the ethnic  cleansing, and that anger is shared by many. This is film is her  showing how bad things can get when good me do nothing. And that's  basically the aim of IN THE LAND OF BLOOD AND HONEY.  The backdrop is the Bosnian war but right at the heart of the story are  two key characters, Danijel played by a Bosnian Serb actor named Goran  Kostic and the other is Ajla played by a Bosnian named Zana Marjanovic.  They became representations of the two opposing sides and they're both  played by solid actors, Kostic has that arresting presence about him,  he could be sympathetic at one point, because he's stuck between  loyalty to his father and his love for Ajla, but at another point he  could also be distant. Kostic's emotional range is wide and the same  goes with Marjanovic, who is absolutely captivating. At one point she  makes you believe that her character Ajla is the protagonist, at  another point she makes you feel like she may be untrustworthy. It's a  very complicated love story because what those two characters have is  not exactly true love, despite whatever feeling they have for each  other, Danijel badly wanted Ajla to be a Serb and Ajla knows that she's  sleeping with the enemy. The line between the oppressor and the  oppressed gets blurred and everyone is guilty.","['actress angelina jolie makes her directorial debut in in the lands of blood and honey. the film is about two key characters, one of them a serb and the other a bosnian. ajla marjanovic is a very complex love story because what those two characters have is not exactly true love.']","[""i'd have to somewhat agree with those here think that this is more or to a lesser extent angelina jolie's very own schindler's list and there's a bit of romeo & amp ; juliet element to it as well, because just like the shakespearean classic itself, this too is a tragedy. quite ambitious and daring for a feature directorial debut but i wasn't completely surprised because this film came from an oscar winning actress whose humanitarian work, specially for this region, has been very passionate. jolie's future as a filmmaker looks promising.. jolie doesn't hold back in her effort to show how brutal the bosnian war was. the environment looks authentic and harsh. and just like spielberg's 1993 oscar winning film, in the land of blood and honey also invests most of its time going into details about the killings and the disregard for human life. the raping scenes would be painful for some to watch. i remember i attended the initial screening, it was already a few minutes into the movie and at the door we was a person who i thought at first was the studio's rep but then she told me and was a fellow press member and she be there just to wait until the rape scene ended so she could then re - enter the room and watch the rest of the film. some may argue that this has a one sided story, everybody is entitled to his opinion, if this was indeed a movie that's professional bosnian muslim or pro serb, i wouldn't be able to tell because what i saw was both sides killing each other and none of them was the better. i think jolie is just angry at the fact that the international community did not intervene in time to stop the genocide by many. this is photographic film is her showing how bad things can get when good maine don'thing. and that's basically the aim of in the land of blood and honey. the backdrop is of bosnian war but right at the heart of the story are two key characters, danijel played by a bosnian serb actor named goran kostic and the other is ajla played by a bosnian named zana marjanovic. they became representations of the two opposing sides and they're both played by solid actors, kostic has that arresting presence about him, he could be sympathetic at one point, because he's stuck between loyalty to his father and his love for ajla, but at another point he can also live distant. kostic ' s emotional range is wide and the same goes with marjanovic, world health organization is absolutely captivating. at one point she makes you believe that her character ajla is the protagonist, at another point she makes you feel like she may be untrustworthy. it's a very complicated love story because what those two characters have is not exactly true love, despite whatever feeling they have for each other, danijel badly wanted ajla to be a serb and ajla knows that she's sleeping with the enemy. the line between the oppressor and the oppressed gets blurred and everyone is guilty.""]"

When Slience of the Lambs came out, did everyone think America is full of pyschopaths that eat humans? This is just a movie. Come on! Just because the language is in Korean and the scenes are set in Korea doesn't mean all Koreans are sick people indulging in incest. How stupid can you get? This is a fictional story based on a Japanese comic book, made into a Korean movie! By the way, some of you find the main character eating live octopus sick and in bad taste. If you bothered to check the lifestyle of Koreans, you will know that eating live octopus is very NORMAL in their country.For those people who bashed this movie non-stop. Sorry to lower your spirits but Hollywood is doing a remake of it because it is a well engineered movie with a good twist in the end.There's some black humour in the movie but some people don't seem to appreciate it. I love the part when the hotel owner returned with a brand new set of golden teeth and gave Dae-su the dentist's name card. Told him the service was good and he should try it too. The part when Dae-su beat up some punks while smoking a cigarette, he concluded that 15 years of training was well applied. However when he tried to make love to Mido in the toilet, he found out his 15 years of training has failed him.The ant Mido saw in the train was huge because her loneliness is bigger than Dae-su. In this movie, ants is compared to loneliness because ants live in a big family. At least Dae-su led his first half of his life as a happy guy, married and had a child. He was locked up when he is in his 30s. Maybe that is why his ants is much smaller. Mido grew up parentless and knowing her mother was murdered and his father missing could have been a big blow.In the Oldboy: Ultimate Edition, one of the deleted scenes showed that Woo-jin visited the Hypnotist before the final confrontation with Dae-su. Woo-jin told the Hypnotist that Dae-su will come visit her a few years later and he instructed her to hynotise Dae-su to be a happy man.In the ending of Oldboy, Dae-su indeed visited the Hypnotist. He begged her to erase his painful memory. The Hypnotist advised him that it may fail. The next scene we see Dae-su meeting his girlfriend (daughter). He hugged her and cried when she said 'I love you'. My personal opinion is that he is still the same monster with the painful memories. When the camera panned across the snow. We can only see Dae-su's footsteps walking away from the two chairs. What happened to the Hypnotist's footsteps? Well.. she was killed and hanged on a tree (watch again for her brown coat in the tree branches) because she failed to erase his memories and the monster inside him decided to finish her off. This explains why there is only one set of footprints.'Be it a rock or a grain of sand, in water they sink alike.' The explanation of this phrase is that 'Be it you make love to your sister or your daughter, the weight of the sin is the same.'

Full credit to a great cast, the director Mick Jackson and the distinguished playwright David Hare for his screenplay.Despite knowing the outcome, I found the courtroom scenes really thrilling, and when Mr Justice Gray (Alex Jennings) asks whether David Irving (Timothy Spall) might not have denied the Holocaust in good faith the shock is quite electrifying.The tensions between Deborah Lipstadt (Rachel Weisz) and her legal team are very intense; the solicitor Anthony Julius (Andrew Scott) appears rather arrogant and high-handed but it becomes clear that (to quote Hamlet) he's being 'cruel only to be kind'. This redeems the soap-opera touches, as I see them, in their exchanges. It's understandable that Lipstadt should find the lawyers' strategy perplexing.Similarly, the brilliance of Richard Rampton QC (Tom Wilkinson) in court offsets a tendency towards caricaturing him as a bibulous lawyer with a fund of legal anecdotes.In Timothy Spall's portrayal Irving, representing himself in court, seems dogmatic and devious yet by no means confident of victory. Though clearly concentrating hard, he looks pretty confused. His exchanges with the historian Sir Richard Evans (John Sessions) are embarrassingly unconvincing. At one point he says 'I'm not a Holocaust historian.' That isn't a confession, just an attempt to duck an awkward question from Evans. There's more embarrassment when he tries to look like a good loser.Only one Holocaust survivor appears in the film: a woman who begs Lipstadt to enable her to testify. Others must have been in court as well, but the woman has a symbolic role. Though unable to grant her wish, Lipstadt assures her that 'The voice of suffering will be heard.' Those words are profoundly moving.The voice of suffering was indeed heard. Unfortunately, as James Libson (Jack Lowden), a junior lawyer at the time, has remarked, the longer-term consequences ran counter to expectations.

726,0.0,"This is a remake of the 2008 Swedish vampire film, Let the Right One In. This version is set in 1983 in Los Alamos, New Mexico. The film opens with a policeman (Elias Koteas) visiting a patient in a hospital who has been brought in with severe burns. The scene ends with the patient throwing themselves out of the window. The film backtracks to two weeks earlier where Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is being bullied and tormented at school. He is much younger and smaller than the other children and he is reluctant to fight back. He lives at in a snow-covered apartment block with his only his mother, as his parents have separated. When playing out in the snow one evening, he meets a mysterious girl named Abby (Chloe Moretz) who has moved in with her father (Richard Jenkins). Abby and her father's arrival coincide with a series of gruesome murders across the town. Owen finds Abby to be a curious girl, particular when she says it would be best if they weren't friends, but they gradually work towards a tentative friendship together. Let the Right One In (L\u00e5t den r\u00e4tte komma in) was a mesmerising and quietly haunting film that benefited from a unique setting and a touching original story of friendship between two loners. Director Matt Reeves, whose last film was Cloverfield (2008), has competently placed the story into an American context but it offers few surprises for anyone who has seen the superior original film. There have been just a few scenes that have been slightly altered or omitted altogether and as such, the majority of the story is exactly the same. The new context brings little to the narrative besides some scarce 80s references and transparent contrasts between the vampires and the strict religious beliefs of Owens's mother. There are a few more instances where Abby's gender comes into question but it is handled in a far more obvious and less confronting manner than the first film. For those who have seen the original, the uncertainty and unpredictability has been lost here. For those who have not seen Tomas Alfredson's work, it will be far cheaper to rent than paying to see Let Me In. Although it covers much of the same territory, Let Me In is at least competently made in terms of aesthetics. The film is told with suitable intensity because of the persistently brooding score and the gloomy cinematography. Yet there is also regrettably more blood in this version, leading to some needlessly brutal and surprisingly upsetting deaths. While the film is effective in building the tension in the early scenes, it lacks the restraint and the transcendent beauty of the Swedish film. The original's sense of isolation, through its eerie silences and icy landscapes, is missing. The decision to show Abby's face as a vicious monster and have her snap the neck of her victim after she has collected the blood is a curious decision as well. It diminishes the rather poignant idea of finding humanity even in the most distant beings. In having to cater his film for a mainstream audience, Reeves has missed some of the most crucial essences of the original film. Easily the most pleasing asset of the film is the performance of Kodi Smit-McPhee. Although he is a very young performer he has shown great maturity already in films like The Road (2009). Here he is exceptional as the tormented Owen because he inhabits the film so naturally with his minor stature and his feel for his character's vulnerability amongst his peers. He is going to have an incredibly rich career ahead of him. Chloe Moretz is fine too. She holds a holds a quiet intensity as Abby, even if she is does not quite possess the ghost-like quality of her Swedish counterpart. It is surprising how obvious some of the visual effects used on her character are though, particular when running up a tree to escape. Disappointingly, the adult characters are underused here. Richard Jenkins has a creepy presence but he has minimal time on screen and very few lines too. Elias Koteas has a very standard role as a cop here, who isn't even given a name. It's a very superfluous addition that adds almost nothing to the story.If you have already seen Let the Right One In there is very little reason to endure this pointless remake. Not only has it been made too soon after the original, it offers very few new additions to the narrative as well, reducing the surprises and the spontaneity that were found in the original. Those who have not seen the Swedish version but are interested in this film should rent the original instead because it will be cheaper and because it is a magnificent film in its own right. This film is slickly made but it lacks the delicacy of Alfredson's work and it is certainly not for the squeamish. Kodi Smit-McPhee is very good here but even his fine performance still makes this a tough sell.","['this is a remake of the 2008 Swedish vampire film, let the Right One In. the film is set in 1983 in los alamos, new mexico. there are regrettably more blood in this version.']","[""this is a remake of the 2008 swedish vampire film, let the left one in. this version is set in 1983 at los alamos, new mexico. the film opens with a policeman ( elias koteas ) visiting a patient in a hospital who has been brought in with severe burns. the scene ends with the patient role throwing themselves out of the window. the film backtracks to two weeks being bullied and frustrate at school. he is much younger and smaller than the other children and he is reluctant to fight back. he lives at in a snow - covered cell block with his only his mother, as his parents have separated. when alone out in the snow one evening, he meets a mysterious girl named abby ( chloe moretz ) who has moved in with her father ( richard jenkins ). abby and her father's arrival coincide with a series of gruesome murders across the town. owen finds abby to be a curious girl, particular when she says it would be best if they weren't friends, but they gradually work towards a tentative friendly relationship together. let the right one in ( l \\ u00e5t den r \\ u00e4tte komma in ) was a mesmerising and quietly haunting film that benefited from a unique setting and a touching original story of friendship between two girls. director matt reeves, whose last film was cloverfield ( 2008 ), has competently placed the story into an american context but it offers few surprises for anyone who has seen the superior original film. there have been just a few scenes that have become slightly altered or omitted altogether and as such, the majority of the story is exactly the same. the new context brings little to the narrative besides some scarce 80s references and transparent contrasts between the vampires and the strict religious beliefs of owens's mother. there are a few more instances where abby's gender comes into question but it is handled in a far more obvious and less confronting manner than the first film. for those who have seen the original, the uncertainty and unpredictability has been lost here. for those that have not witnessed tomas alfredson's work, it will be far cheaper to rent than pay to see let me in. although it covers much of the same territory, letting me in is at least competently made in terms on aesthetics. the film is told with suitable intensity because of the persistently brooding score and the gloomy cinematography. yet there is also regrettably more blood in this version, leading to some needlessly brutal and surprisingly upsetting deaths. while the film is effective in building the tension in the early scenes, it lacks the restraint and the transcendent beauty of the swedish film. the original's sense of isolation, through its eerie silences and icy landscapes, is missing. the decision to show abby's face as a vicious monster and have her snap the neck of her victim after she has collected the blood is a curious decision as well. it diminishes the rather poignant idea of finding humanity even in the most distant beings. in having to cater his film for a mainstream audience, reeves has missed some of the most crucial essences of the original film. easily the most pleasing asset of the film is the performance of kodi smit - mcphee. although he is a very young performer he has shown great maturity already in films like the road ( 2009 ). here he is exceptional as the tormented owen because he inhabits the film so naturally with his minor stature and his feel for his character's vulnerability amongst his peers. he is going to have an incredibly rich career ahead of him. chloe moretz is fine too. she holds a holds a quiet intensity as abby, even if she is does not quite possess the ghost - like quality of her swedish counterpart. it is surprising how obvious some of the visual effects used on her quality are though, particular when running up a tree to escape. disappointingly, the adult characters are underused here. richard jenkins has a creepy presence but he has minimal time on screen and very few lines too. elias koteas has a very standard role as a cop here, who isn't even give a name. it's a very superfluous addition that adds almost nothing to the story. if you have already seen let the right one in there is very little reason to endure this pointless remake. not only has it been made too soon after the original, it offers very few new additions to the narrative as well, reducing the surprises and the spontaneousness that were found in the original. those who have not seen the swedish version but are interested in this film should rent the original instead because it will be cheaper and because it is a magnificent film in its own right. this film is slickly made but it lacks the delicacy of alfredson's work and it is certainly not for the squeamish. kodi smit - mcphee is very good here but even his fine performance still makes this a tough sell.""]"

748,0.0,"I don't know where the hate for this movie is coming from, unless it's from those with weak stomachs. A lot of critics seemed to really enjoy it, if they reviewed it at all. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and think of it as the best thriller to come along since Memento. Both movies have their gimmicks - short-term memory loss in Memento and a small hypnosis bit in Oldboy, but it's just one twist of many in these movies. The thing that strikes me the most about this movie is the lead actor who plays Oh-Daesu. He is transformed from a happy drunk in the beginning to a worn and broken shell of a man, full of anger and remorse. All good stories show the character going through a journey of change, and Oldboy succeeded very well. The lead actor really carries the picture.This film is also a visual joy to watch, particularly the early scenes of his imprisonment and the passage of time in his cell. I'm a Takishi Miike fan, so the violence didn't bother me at all, except for one scene that put The Marathon Man to shame and made me scream. It's been a long time since I did that during a movie and it was a lot of fun. I really loved the cinematography - it never felt overdone. The infamous hallway fight scene was extremely cool, just one of those technical feats that make you say \""How did they do that?\"" I didn't see the big \""secret\"" coming, so it made the ending a disturbing shock to me, but it also seemed consistent with the characters.

757,0.0,"Hammer Film Productions' return to cinemas after more than thirty years was especially surprising and unnecessarily difficult. They chose to reintroduce the brand by remaking the great Swedish vampire film Let The Right One In. The choice, from a historical perspective, isn't unusual. Vampires have enjoyed a surge of popularity they haven't experienced since Hammer pumped out its own films its first life. What the company failed to do was realize the special fondness the original's fans have for it. Not since The Silence of the Lambs was there a horror film so recognized by film critics and those who saw it as capable of making a statement about what it means to be human. The film is a calculated discussion on why people (or former people) are lonely and what, if anything, they can do to find some company.A large part of the outrage surrounding the English-language adaptation of John Lindqvist's novel originates from the latent desire many horror fans feel about their genre not having the same respect as others. Lindqvist wrote the screenplay for the first movie, which means the film's tangential treatment of the novel's secondary characters is his manifestation of the translation from book to screen. There was no need for another film, or at least not one as insipidly similar to its parent as is Let Me In. Great films of other genres are rarely, if ever, remade. If Hammer were as respectful of the Swedish film as the interviews read, they would have purchased the rights to Lindqvist's other novels. He has a few that haven't been translated into English. Instead, they produced a new version of the same story that was filmed just two years ago.The story is relocated from Stockholm to New Mexico, where it's always snowy. The camera focuses on several iconography of U.S. culture: dollar bills, the pledge of allegiance, and flags. Just in case you forgot, this movie takes place in New Mexico, which is part of the United States. This is almost Hammer's admission that the film isn't mainstream enough to work for typical movie-goers.And it isn't. As the story unfolds, the little boy character Owen, meets and befriends a young vampire entity by the name of Abby and asks if they can \""go steady.\"" Abby appears to be feminine, although the character prefers to identify as genderless. Abby says, \""Would you like me even if I wasn't a girl?\"" This struck the funny bones of several people at the screening I attended.Abby is still a vampire child that travels with a companion who provides her (his) meals. Abby meets Owen at an apartment complex playground and helps him overcome his anxiety about being bullied at school. Owen falls in love and continues to hang out with Abby even after he learns his (her) secret. The two skip town after Abby murders Owen's bullies.The success of the first movie was a culmination of several thematic techniques and careful direction. Even the title is a reference to the central idea of loneliness. The score is quite and foreboding at first. String instruments accompany piano arrangements to invoke isolated terror. As vampire and child come to terms with their affections for one another, only soft touches of the piano are heard. The film's later tenderness is manifest when the child is rescued by the vampire. His head is forced underwater by bullies. The camera is focused on his face. In the background, we hear the vampire approach and see a head sink behind the boy.The new version lacks these elements, which prevent it from being a great film. The score follows a typical tension-building setup and memorable shots like the underwater one aren't there. The vampire was made to look more violent than in the original. It isn't horrible but its goodness is entirely plagiarized.Recommended","['""let the right one in"" is a calculated discussion on why people are lonely. the score follows a typical tension-building setup and memorable shots aren\'t there. it\'s not horrible but its goodness is entirely plagiarized.']","['hammer film productions\'return to cinemas after more than thirty years was especially surprising and unnecessarily difficult. they chose to reintroduce the brand by remaking the great swedish vampire film let the right one in. the choice, from a historical perspective, isn\'t unusual. vampire releases enjoyed a surge of popularity they haven\'t experienced since hammer pumped through its own films its first life. what the company failed to do was realize the special fondness the original\'s fans have for it. not since the silence of the lambs was there a horror film so recognized by film critics and those who saw it as capable of making a statement about what it mean to be human. the film is a calculated discussion on why people ( or former people ) are lonely and what, if anything, they can do to find some company. a large part of the outrage surrounding the english - language adaptation of john lindqvist\'s novel originates from the latent desire many horror fans feel about their genre not having the same respect as others. lindqvist wrote an screenplay for the first movie, which means the film\'s tangential treatment of the novel\'s secondary characters is his manifestation of the translation from book to book. there was no need for another film, or at least not one as insipidly similar to its parent as is let me in. great films of other genres are rarely, if ever, remade. should hammer were as respectful of the swedish film as the interviews read, they would have purchased the copyright to lindqvist\'s other novels. he published a few that haven\'t been translations into english. instead, they produced a new version of the same story that was filmed just two years ago. the story is relocated from stockholm to new mexico, where it\'s always snowy. the camera focuses on several iconography of u. s. culture : dollar bills, the pledge of allegiance, and signal flag. just in case you forgot, this movie takes place in new mexico, which is part of the united states. this is almost hammer\'s admission that the film isn\'t mainstream enough to work for their movie - goers. and it isn\'t. as the story unfolds, the little girl character owen, meets and befriends a young vampire entity by the name of abby and asks if they can \\ "" go steady. \\ "" abby appears to be feminine, although the character prefers to identify as genderless. abby says, \\ "" would you like me even if i wasn\'t a several people at the screening i attended. abby is still a vampire child that travels with a companion who provides her ( his ) meals. abby meets owen at an apartment complex playground and helps him overcome his anxiety about being bullied at school. owen falls in love and continues to hang out with abby even after he learns his ( her ) secret. the two skip town after abby murders owen\'s bullies. the success of the first movie was a culmination of several thematic techniques and careful direction. even the title is a reference to the central idea of loneliness. the score is quite and foreboding at first. string instruments accompany piano arrangements to invoke isolated terror. as vampire and child come to terms with their affections for one another, only soft touches of the piano are heard. the film\'s later tenderness is manifest when the child is rescued by the vampire. his head is forced underwater by bullies. the camera is focused on his face. in the background, we hear the vampire advance and see a head sink behind the boy. the new version lacks these elements, which forestall it from being a great film. the score follows a typical tension - building setup and memorable shots like the underwater one aren\'t there. the vampire was made to look more violent than in the original. it isn\'t horrible but its goodness is entirely plagiarized. recommended']"

766,0.0,"In writing this review I'm going to disregard the painful ethical problems that come along with this series because in my opinion, they are plentiful. The Twilight Saga has come to be the home run at Yankee Stadium for tween girl entertainment, it's become iconic but not for any good reason, and it's become a joke and a disappointment to modern American cinema. However, it - unfortunately - has become somewhat of a guilty pleasure.I'm going to start with the bad parts here. I sat there entranced by what I saw in front of me. No, it wasn't Taylor Lautner's abs or Robert Pattinson's jawline but I was trying to figure out where in the world Davide Slade or his DP went to film school. I wondered who taught him, who told him that it was okay to shoot an entire 2 hour movie in a close up. Forget about the fact that he made Taylor Lautner actually look unattractive with unflattering angles and the worst lighting configurations ever recorded on film, think about the action sequences when you could hardly tell what was happening. I guess I kind of get that maybe he was attempting to make it look like they were moving in super speed but it came off in a very different way. Flashing a bunch of quick images in front of my face that almost don't have a purpose isn't good technique... it makes the movie look like a music video. I prefer, when I'm watching a movie, to know where I am. I like to see backgrounds and sets and atmosphere. I don't, however, like to come extremely close to being able to count the nose hairs under Robert Pattinson's face.The writing is just a tad off in this series. It's bumpy. Of course, a lot of book adaptations can feel that way especially when you have to fit in the content and make sure to schedule Taylor Lautner to take his shirt off at least 15 times. I hate the re-work with the Riley and Bree characters, it's 100% unnecessary. We have enough characters to focus on as it is especially as we learn the daunting pasts of two more of the Cullen clan, Jasper and Rosalie.The acting has \""improved.\"" Rob, Taylor, and Kristen definitely aren't up for any Oscars but their probably shoe-ins for some more moon men. With that said, I was as impressed as you can be with the acting in this series. Rob didn't seem to resemble a rock anymore, he's moved on to something more like molasses. Taylor has kind of grown into himself and doesn't seem afraid anymore. And Kristen, she finally has gotten rid of the grunting she does. She suddenly doesn't stumble over every word anymore though there was an awful lot of mumbling. Nikki Reed, did a great job with her monologue I thought. That impressed me. Jackson Rathbone on the other hand, not so much. Jasper comes out of his shell a little bit in the story and apparently also adapts a southern accent that he didn't have before. Anna Kendrick was perfect as Jessica, the graduation speech was genuine and brilliantly delivered. But Billy Burke, oh, what a life saver he is. He is the white knight of this series but I'm not sure anyone else has noticed yet. Congrats, pops.Overall, taking into account all of the things I love and hate about this series it was good. I enjoyed it. You have to look at it in a glass of half full kind of way. If this is the best we're gonna get then, okay, it's not so bad. Right? Those of us who aren't 12 and ask a little more from a film can tolerate it finally. Critics can rejoice? No, that's still a bit of a stretch but hey... all we can do now if hope for the best for the final two chapters and Bill Condon will hopefully try to save us all.","[""the Twilight Saga has become the home run at Yankee Stadium for tween girl entertainment. it's become a joke and a disappointment to modern american cinema. the writing is just a tad off in this series.""]","['in writing this review i\'m going to disregard the painful ethical problems that come along with this series because in my opinion, they are plentiful. the twilight saga has come to be the home run at yankee stadium for tween sports entertainment, it\'s become iconic but not for any good reason, and it\'s become a joke and a disappointment to modern american cinema. however, it - unfortunately - has become somewhat of a guilty pleasure. i\'m going to start with the bad parts here. i sat there entranced by what i saw in front of me. no, it wasn\'t taylor lautner\'s abs or robert collins\'s jawline so i was trying to figure out where in the world davide slade or his dp went to film school. i wondered who taught him, who told him that it was okay to shoot an entire ii hour movie in a close up. forget about the fact that he made taylor lautner actually look unattractive with unflattering angles and the worst lighting configurations ever recorded on film, think about the action sequences when you could hardly tell what was above. i guess i kind of get that maybe he was attempting to make it look like they were moving in super speed but it came off in a rattling different way. flashing a bunch of quick ikon in front of my face that almost don\'t have a face isn\'t good technique... it makes the movie look like a music video. i prefer, when i\'m watching a movie, to know where i stood. i like to see backgrounds and sets and atmosphere. i don\'t, however, like to come extremely close to being able to count the nose hairs nether robert pattinson\'s face. the writing is just a tad off in this series. it\'s bumpy. after course, a lot of book adaptations can feel that way especially when you have to fit in the content and make sure to schedule taylor lautner to take his shirt off at least fourteen times. personally hate the re - work with the riley and novak characters, it\'s 100 % unnecessary. we have enough characters to focus on as it is especially as we learn the daunting pasts of two more of the cullen clan, jasper and rosalie. the acting has \\ "" improved. \\ "" rob, taylor, and kristen definitely aren\'t up for any oscars but their probably horseshoe - ins for some more moon men. with that said, i was as impressed as you can be with the acting in this series. rob didn\'t seem to resemble a rock anymore, he\'s moved on to something more like molasses. taylor has kind of grown into himself and doesn\'t seem afraid anymore. and kristen, she finally has gotten rid of the grunting she does. she suddenly doesn\'t stumble over every holy scripture anymore though there was an awful lot of mumbling. nikki reed, did a great job with her monologue i thought. that impressed me. jackson rathbone on the other hand, not so much. jasper comes out of his shell a little bit in the story and apparently also adapts a southern accent that he didn\'t have before. anna kendrick was perfect as jessica, the graduation speech was genuine and brilliantly delivered saver he is. he is the white knight of this series but i\'m not sure anyone else has noticed yet. congrats, pops. overall, taking into account all of the things i love and hate about this serial it was good. i enjoyed it. you take to look at it in a glass of half full kind of way. if this is the best we\'re gonna get then, okay, it\'s not so bad. right? those of us who aren\'t 12 and ask a little more from a film can tolerate it finally. critics can rejoice? no, that\'s still a bit of a stretch but hey... all we can do now if hope for the best for the final two chapters and bill condon will hopefully try to save us all.']"

Their faces disgusted me, and their body structure--ugh. Don't even get me started on their body structure! There bodies are fat and plump, but their legs are as skinny as sticks! Plus, they acted so annoying I wished that at some point, a giant dragon would eat them all up, then a happy song comes on (\""Sunshine, Lollipops, and Rainbows\"" from the Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs soundtrack would work perfectly), the movie ends, and my oldest sister (who took me to see the movie in the first place) gets her money back, which she uses to buy us ice cream.

So I went to see it.I should have known I wouldn't like it because I NEVER like the movies that all the critics rave about. Why is that? Why do critics like movies that suck? Perhaps they feel that they need to get people to see movies that they think bring up Important issues. That is, issues that the critics deem as Important, i.e. gay cowboys.Anywho, the movie sucked.First off, I think the two actors who played the gay cowboys took their roles a bit too seriously, because it appeared and sounded like they had big wads of chew in their mouths throughout the entire movie, and I could not understand about 90 percent of their dialogue. Perhaps I would have enjoyed the movie a bit more had I been able to understand it. Who knows? O.k., now about that scene. You know the scene everyone is talking about? As far as sex scenes go, it stunk. I mean, OUCH! Ever heard of lubrication people? Supposedly, we're to think these two guys never participated in this particular type of intimacy so I mean, come on, that's gotta hurt. There was not even any foreplay. Just wham bam thank you. ..sir. Sheesh.All in all, the movie just stank. The dialogue, the acting, the story line. It all stank. There was no one in the movie that you could root for. The two main characters were despicable human beings who ruined not only their own lives, but also the lives of everyone around them, i.e. their wives and children. Not to mention two hours of my life. They were just as likely to punch each other as kiss each other.Part of the problem is that I don't like depressing movies. Or depressing books. Why is it that the critics always root for the depressing stuff? It appears that critics believe books and movies have to be depressing in order to be worthy of praise. Not me. I like movies and books that celebrate the triumph of the human spirit. Adversity is o.k. as long as our hero or heroin learns how to triumph in spite of it.

In a way, I even feel sorry for her, even though she is making a bundle off this dismal movie. I have a feeling \""Twilight\"" will be a \""flash in the pan\"". It is immensely popular right now, but I seriously doubt it will sustain its popularity. This is the sad part for Meyer; she's a passing fad. I am sure this horrible movie, and the almost inevitable horrible sequels it will spawn will be the only time Meyer's work finds its way to the silver screen.Her series will not be remade like Marvel Comics films \""Hulk\"" and \""The Punisher\"". After this, that's it. She had one shot and now it's gone to Hell. I cannot understand anyone who tries to defend the \""Twilight\"" movie. My guess is they must be die-hard fans of the book and can't stand to admit to themselves how bad the movie sucked.I think the decision to put Catherine Hardwicke in the director's chair was a huge mistake. If the book had detailed Bella's exploits of promiscuous sex and intravenous drug use maybe she would have been more in her element, but it didn't. She makes a complete and total mess of this movie.Robert Pattinson was absolutely horrendous as Edward Cullen. Never before have I ever seen such melodramatic, wooden acting. All I can say is he better have a financial planner, because he'll have to figure out how to stretch his \""Twilight\"" paycheck the rest of his life. I foresee the acting roles drying up real quick once the hype dies down for \""Twilight\"". He may have played a vampire in this movie, but he would have been better suited to play Frankenstein with the size of that head! Either that or he could be a stand-in for Robin Williams with those super hairy arms he's sporting.Seriously, how did he get the part? Was he truly the best they could find? I sincerely doubt it.

The only actor in the movie who did a halfway decent job was Cam Gigandet. Other than that, this movie was a complete waste of time. I would give it a \""0\"" out of 10, but the lowest it will let you rate is a \""1\"". The cinematography is a joke. What is with all the close-ups and spinning shots?

886,0.0,"Shawshank is on TNT approximately five million times a year. It is the second-highest rated film on IMDb, and it was nominated for seven Oscars. It is a movie that can make grown men cry. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins deliver great performances. Thomas Newman's original score is beautiful. It's an engaging film about perseverance, friendship, will power, and hope.But then again, does it really belong in the same company as Godfather, Godfather II, Schindler's List, and other consensus top-ten films? Is it really one of the ten best films of all time? First off, the villain of the film, Warden Norton, is an incredibly cartoonish, two dimensional bad guy. He and Cal from Titanic could have a \""pure-evil-for-the-sake-of-being-pure-evil\"" standoff. Aside from greed, we have no idea what made him who he was. The Warden is pure evil, and is willing to kill the prisoner who can help prove Andy's innocence in cold blood. And yet, even though Andy is the one man who could expose him and all his criminal dealings, he doesn't do the simplest thing and just kill Andy. Why not? Because Andy has to wind up hugging Red on the beach years later.Secondly, think about the scene where Andy locks himself in a room and plays classical music over the loudspeakers to the rest of the prisoners, who stop in the courtyard and stare up in awe and wonder. Are you kidding me? The scene tries to be a powerful, emotional peak in the film, but it comes off as laughably implausible, even in the 1950's.Finally, the movie makes it a little too easy on the audience by giving it all the answers. Is Andy guilty? Does he really escape? Will he and Red ever meet up again? Nothing is left for the audience to wonder about, no ambiguity \u2014 everything is spoon-fed to the audience in tasty, happy-ending bites, right up to the final \""hug on the beach\"" scene.

887,0.0,"BOTTOM LINE: Interesting premise makes ordinary \""oops we shouldn't have done this\"" film into a pretty good time-paradox entry. B+PREMISE &amp; LOGIC: There are places on Earth where people get lost and never found (eg, Bermuda Triangle) because time moves slower there. This means thousands of years can pass outside these places but only a few hours pass inside. This is one of those places, with layers of time paradox within. Logic can be suspended as long as writing is consistent and follows through. This film delivers because it is not simply an excuse for appealing teens to be hunted in terror, but rather is the gateway to a multitude of possible outcomes. CHARACTERS: I get them, in a one-dimensional fashion. Many such 1-D characters are unlikeable because they're cliches, caricatures or just obnoxious. Here, they are just ordinary enough to enjoy, and just extraordinary enough to believe in their ability to survive. Nothing unique, but the writers kept it simple and pleasant. Refreshingly, the cast does not engage in social commentary distractions, so dialogue is driven by nothing more high-minded than situation and attachment. PLOT: The trajectory is fine, and the outcome and resolutions satisfying enough, given who these people are and what's going on. However, and there is a however, the movie tries to do too much. While indeed there must be tragedy to overcome into triumph, some of the \""Flintstones\"" scenes were too simplistic to be so long. The multiple layers of time compression were also just so much window dressing, with no exposition beyond showing it. So it ends up, even with a unique ending, like a pretty good episode of the old Irwin Allen LOST IN SPACE, which is not a bad thing!OVERALL: Setting up these likeable characters, and leaving aspects of time-slip unexplored, added up to me desiring this to be a pilot for a TV series, which is how it plays, rather than a self-contained movie experience. It reminds me a bit of Sliders, though that cast was more charismatic, and one might rightly also say it should continue episodically like Quantum Leap or Time Tunnel.","['""oops we shouldn\'t have done this"" is a pretty good time-paradox entry. it is not simply an excuse for appealing teens to be hunted in terror. the cast does not engage in social commentary distractions.']","['bottom line : interesting premise makes ordinary \\ "" oops we shouldn\'l have done this \\ "" film into a pretty good motion - paradox entry. story + premise & amp ; system 4 logic : there are places on earth where people get lost and never found ( eg, romantic triangle ) because time flies slower there. this means thousands of years can pass outside these places but only a few hours pass inside. this is one of those seat, with layers of time paradox within. logic can be suspended as long as writing is consistent and follows through. this film delivers because it is not simply an excuse for appealing teens to be hunted in terror, but rather is the gateway to a multitude of possible outcomes. characters : i bewilder them, in a one - dimensional fashion. many such 1 - d characters are unlikeable because they\'re cliches, caricatures or just obnoxious. here, they are just ordinary enough to enjoy, and simply extraordinary enough to trust in their ability to survive. nothing unique, but the writers kept it simple and pleasant. refreshingly, the cast does not engage in social comedic distractions, so dialogue is drive by nothing more high - minded than spot and attachment. plot : the trajectory is fine, and the outcome and resolutions satisfying enough, given who these people are and what\'s going on. however, and there is a however, the movie tries to do too much. while indeed there must be tragedy to overcome into triumph, some of the \\ "" flintstones \\ "" scenes were too simplistic to be so long. the multiple layers of time compression were also just so much window dressing, with no exposition with a unique ending, like a pretty good episode of the old irwin allen lost in space, which is not a bad thing! overall : setting up these likeable characters, and leaving aspects of time - slip unexplored, added up to characters desiring this to be a pilot for a tv series, which is how it plays, rather than a self - contained movie experience. it reminds me a pair of sliders, though that cast was more charismatic, and one might rightly also say it should continue episodically like quantum leap or time walker.']"

It is based on a classic fairy tale known as The Snow Queen. But you would think that in 2013 they might try to make it appeal to people today. Well you'd be wrong.If you've seen the trailer for this movie, they market it as a movie more in the vein of Ice Age. There's a funny-looking snowman walking on ice and struggling to stay on his feet; he later winds up sneezing so hard that he blows his head off. All you see is the snowman and a likable moose. Instead, Frozen is actually a ridiculously old-fashioned movie about princesses. This movie is more like The Sound of Music than anything from this century. The songs all sound old and dated, just like everything else in the movie. The only good thing in the movie is that snowman, and they don't even bring him in until halfway through the film.I understand that this is a movie aimed at kids, but most knowledgeable film studios nowadays at least try to entertain the adults watching as well. I was bored out of my mind. Then after briefly falling asleep, I woke up to see a prince trying to decapitate the princess with a sword. Sure, that's what little kids want to see.

She lived in Phoenix, Arizona, but is whiter-skinned than a piece of paper. Considering Arizona is basically a large desert, this makes no sense.My next argument is the acting.

He displays a wide variety of emotions and has a remarkable and intense presence on the screen.Timothy Spall accurately portrays David Irving, a human being who out of vanity and sheer craving for recognition is pretty much indifferent to the question if the applause so desired by him comes from the wrong direction.The scene in Auschwitz I found too long and expendable. People standing on rubble did not convey the emotional impact to me that it tried to. And in principle we all know what Auschwitz was like and know the emotional implication.For people like me who are interested in the subject this court room drama can feel like a thriller by times, especially the verbal duels between Richard Rampton and David Irving. The discourse about the gas chambers shows how many claims of the deniers of the Shoah are not really thought out and are ultimately inconsistent with the state of evidence.The movie is of great importance especially today, for we are living in an age of relativism, sometimes even called the \""post-fact\"" era. Shermer and Grobman have a good chapter in their book \""Denying History\"", which demonstrates how in the science of history the pendulum swung into the opposite direction in a counter reaction to the (not accurate) convictions of the 19th century \u2013 we can describe everything in history objectively and comprehensively \u2013 and it did this in an excessively strong way. And how this could explain the emergence of phenomena like the denial of the Shoah.The movie can serve as a starting point for anyone interested in the topic, with the movie pointing to the very extensive verdict of the judge. Furthermore the expert witnesses Richard Evans and Robert van Pelt appear in the movie, each one of them has written a very good and well documented book about his findings in the trial.That means that thanks to the trial Irvings lying is thoroughly documented now. That is the reason why the historian Evans could give his book the title \""Lying about Hitler\"" \u2013 because Irving actually IS a liar, and it is documented beyond any doubt now. It is not \""Hollywood\"" or this movie which tries to \""discredit\"" Irving. Irving discredited himself with his lying, everyone can see this today just by comparing the historical sources with Irving's works.Furthermore as the movie correctly addresses it is Irving who attacked free speech. Had he won his libel trial every publishing company and author would have to think twice if they ever say anything critical of a denier of the Shoah anymore. This fact is often missed or even distorted into the opposite.Some people coming here seem to feel the urge to try to push their ideologically driven agenda by voting this movie down and any positive review of it.

All I can say is that the movie is quite enjoyable but too hard to understand for most people in the audience when what causing the \""outbreak\"" cannot be seen. It's true that some of the scenes in this movie was quite suspenseful and I enjoyed it. But there's some scene that doesn't quite make sense in the movie. For example, compare the situation when John Leguizamo character got \""infected\"", and Mark Walhberg's toward the end where the toxins supposedly at the peak of its potency. He should have got infected too, but being the main character of the movie I guess that logic is impossible for him to happen. When I came out of the theater and discussed this movie, no matter how I tried to explain the plot and defend the reason things happened in the movie the more I realize that, they were right and I was wrong.

978,0.0,"Now there are good reasons to make a film like this when considering the demographic. Has a strong young female protagonist; a rags-to-riches story. I can see where teen girls would like this and find inspiration in such. And WWE is seeing increased interest from female viewers. But they must not be familiar with the mechanics of wrestling to fully buy this film.The initial presentation of the Knight family rang true, authentic and affable. Putting it in their actual home was a good idea. Frost and Headley were great in the roles as Paige's parents and Puge did a very good job as Paige. Lowden as her brother made a good mentor but it tried to take the high road and make Paige an angelic character.Her tryout had that great moment where she basically said this was her only avenue and impressed that she was up to the challenge. (In reality, she was rejected in her first attempt and was taken in her second.)But once it crossed over to Paige going alone to the US to train, it quickly devolved into inauthentic melodrama. Just as a drama, I didn't appreciate that we're introduced to this strong young woman who then collapses at every avenue because she's lonely and out-of-place. There was mention in the documentary of her loneliness but there was no debate about her staying put, unlike the fictional aspect in the film.I found two elements interesting, too, as it was partially produced by the WWE.The film features three women recruited to wrestle who'd never wrestled before. Found that odd as it was very self-critical when they do have many women who're authentic and good wrestlers with substantial training. Yes, it's true that they have the T&amp;A element there, but still didn't see how those three characters earned their \""bones.\"" They should not have been there.Then there was the muddled WWE mythos of the wrestler as entertainer whose main job is to bring the best match they can. Assume that they were trying to forward the \""passion\"" for this, but didn't think that was the best vehicle. Not the movie they were making. I do think there's a wrestling movie that's more exploratory. \""The Wrestler\"" a few years ago was extremely good and dark, but did cover all bases of such. The Vince Vaughn character tried to put some \""bitterness\"" into that mix, but was too little.Briefly within was the pain of the other brother in realizing that he'll never achieve his dream and make the big time, like his sister. But, as per the companion documentary this was based on, it shows that the reality was he took it in stride. The element of him with a new baby was total fiction vs. the documentary that took place at the same time as this dramatized film.(And in the film there was a cursory back story about the 2nd older brother, which was complete fiction, as per the documentary.)Depicted in a few short months (which was actually 3 years in real life), she forms a bond with the three other women and finds a way to go forward towards her goal. They establish that she had a pending task of improving her mic/interview skills, which was never resolved, even into the ending. Not true in real life as Paige is very good on the mic, an essential for any wrestler. The three years she was in the \""minor league\"" would have resolved any of that.Throughout the film, we're clearly and repeatedly reminded that pro-wrestling is predetermined. That's true. It wasn't shown but matches are usually worked out between the two wrestlers. The outcome is known.Which made the ending very manufactured and false. Yes, Paige did win the title that night but was depicted as if the outcome was in doubt. Like she actually won it in a real wrestling match. Absolutely not. She would have known she was going to win the title (another YouTube source with her stated she knew an hour before, if true) and her and AJ Lee would have had a discussion about such. (The \""out of nowhere\"" wrestler winning the title has been done before. It's called a \""push\"" on that person's wrestling character.)In reality, she was a champion in her time in NXT and would have not been brought to the main roster unless she was fully capable and not hesitant. In the film, she was shown to be very hesitant and the actual exchange with AJ Lee was not accurate and can be found on YouTube.Now there is a very difficult road to hoe when it comes to the actual Paige. Granted, I do think she's a good role model for young girls and was a very good wrestler. Her achievements were impressive.But any wrestling fan has known her subsequent troubles with drugs, erratic behavior, several relationships and even a sex tape. As a wrestling fan, knowing that made watching this fictional angelic Paige hard to accept.(She had even been to the US previously as she wrestled there before, as she had also wrestled all over Europe.)So, if you're a wrestling fan and know the business, this will let you down. Worth a look, just because there are no wrestling movies.What it did suffer from was that there really was no middle act. In reality, Paige worked for three years in NXT and continued to gain experience and credibility. That's great and all but film relies on the three-act structure. Being that it wasn't there, they had to manufacture the difficulties and it didn't work.Always good to see The Rock be The Rock, as the two scenes with him were enjoyable and funny. But I assume he was an uncredited writer and director, because an amateurish quality came through in such.","['the film has a strong young female protagonist; a rags-to-riches story. but it does suffer from the muddled WWE mythos of the wrestler as entertainer. a few years ago, ""The Wrestler"" was extremely good and dark, but did cover all bases.']","['now there are good reasons to make a film with this when considering the demographic. has a strong young female protagonist ; a rags - to - riches story. i can see where teen girls would wish this and find inspiration in such. and wwe is seeing our interest from female viewers. but they must not be familiar with the mechanics of wrestling to fully buy this film. the initial presentation of the knight family rang true, authentic and affable. putting it in their existent home was a good idea. frost and headley were great in the roles as paige\'s parents and puge did a very good job as paige. lowden as her brother made a good mentor but it tried to take the high road and make paige an angelic character. her tryout had that great feeling where she basically said this was her only avenue and impressed that she was up to the challenge.

He stays up late at night afraid the Jews will kill them. He claims that the husband and wife have transformed into new creatures to which they show cockroaches walking on the ground.

The two main characters were not believable as brothers and they had zero chemistry together. The attempted humour sprinkled throughout the movie was too childish for a serious drama. A true plot was nowhere to be found. I did enjoy seeing Margot Kidder though, seeing as I thought she was ill and had long retired from acting. Anyhow, her appearance was very brief and didn't make up for the other failures. Although noted by others, I truly did not notice any standing ovation once the credits rolled. Also, I was surprised to see a uniformed policeman in the audience.....so weird!!! In conclusion, this was a very poor, made-for-TV movie at best.

For example when he was chasing an African arms dealer, the arms dealer jumped and landed better, thus making me think the arms dealer should have been Bond instead.The movie is dumb because when the arms dealer had a chance to kill Bond by stepping on his hand when Bond was desperately hanging on to a crane hundreds of feet above the ground, the arms dealer passed up the chance for some dumb reason. Wait, I know why, it's so Bond can recover and continue to chase him. Duh!Craig does not convince as Bond. When shirtless, he looks like a gorilla rather than a suave secret agent. He is ugly (sorry) but he can act a little (but not enough to convince he is Bond). He looks most of the time like a p*ssed-off Vladimir Putin.The girl Eva Green has a nice complexion but isn't drop dead gorgeous I'm afraid. On a scale of 1 to 10, Daniela Bianchi being 10, I'd give Green a 3.Poker so tediously slow it is like old maids playing Old Maid.A meandering plot that bores ultimately and is way too l-o-n-g.Oh by the way, no Q (therefore no clever Q gadgets) and no Moneypenny.Not featuring Miss Moneypenny I think was a particularly bad mistake because Moneypenny has always been there to guide James Bond. For example in 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' Moneypenny went as far as to save Bond's job by changing Bond's resignation letter to one requesting two weeks' leave, and in 'Live And Let Die' she saved Bond embarrassment by keeping M from discovering the beautiful Italian secret agent hiding in Bond's closet. Since Bond is in Casino starting out as a secret agent, it is only logical that Miss Moneypenny should be around to help in some way.Worst of the Bond movies therefore because it is so un-Bondlike and dumb. See 'From Russia With Love', 'Goldfinger', 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service', 'Diamonds Are Forever', 'Live And Let Die', 'The Spy Who Loved Me', 'The Living Daylights' and 'Goldeneye' for classic Bond.Clunky and self-important - which the Bond franchise never was - Casino is in stark contrast to the humorous 'Live And Let Die' where the acting of Yaphet Kotto alone is worth the price of admission.Or if you just want to see an action movie, there's XXX, The Transporter and Rambo.

This movie deals with how a Christian (Peter) deals with the issue of homosexuality and reconciling how to stay true to his Biblically based beliefs in his life.

1068,0.0,"As I sat back in the comfy leather seats and watched the star-dusted opening credits roll out in front of me, I reminisced about what it felt like watching the Star Wars series for the first time. It has been a long time since that happened and my only hope was that Star Wars: The Last Jedi would be just as mind-boggling as the others. Shame on me for ever doubting the legendary billion-dollar franchise, because (spoiler alert): It is!If you haven't seen the previous installment, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, then I highly recommend you grab some friends to watch it with and get yourself back on track. Otherwise, you will be in for a big surprise. For those who have seen it, then you know that Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) makes an iconic return to the big screen and this time, with a vengeance. Luke went into hiding, undetected, to the Porg-infested island of Ahch-To to die. Rey (Daisy Ridley) has a mission to bring Luke back to fight the Resistance as war is once again brewing against the First Order. Millions of porg-encounters later, Rey finally persuades Luke to lend her his knowledge in combat, leaving Luke unsettled by the strength of her powers.This time around, Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo (Laura Dern) leads the Resistance due to unforeseen circumstances. Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and Holdo go head to head as he refuses to follow Holdo's rules. This creates major conflict in the storyline, as some things don't necessarily go as planned during combat. We are also introduced to a new lead character, Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), a maintenance worker that guards the escape pods. She bonds with Finn (John Boyega) as she takes him to her wealthy home of Canto Bight. Though, there's so much more to this planet than meets the eye.Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) remains high and mighty, just for show. It's evident that he hides something deep within, something he cannot control - a slight hint of compassion. After a head-to-head conflict with Rey and Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis), the film finally reveals who he truly is.\nNow that you have an idea of what the film is about, let's talk about the magic that goes on behind-the-scenes. To be quite honest, the writing has its lows. There are moments when the audience would let out an uncomfortable laugh due to the awkward, juvenile jokes that we know certain characters would never say or do. It felt somewhat out-of-touch with the Star Wars franchise, especially since they are thrown in during the most serious, suspenseful scenes. Despite that, the rest of the screenplay is groundbreaking. It gives the audience what they want and what they didn't know they needed. Also, the cinematography is phenomenal. Shooting in locations such as Ireland and Croatia, the visual effects team make it seem as though they are off in a galaxy far, far away, without straying from its natural beauty. Special effects, as always, are mind-blowing. It's nearly impossible not to fathom light-sabers being real. Top it all off with detailed costume design and award-winning acting, and you've got yourself a masterpiece.Ultimately, Star Wars: The Last Jedi exceeded far beyond my expectations, and I urge you to go out with your Jedi Knight robes and light-sabers and experience it on the big screen. I give it 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18 as well as adults. It opens December 15, 2017 in U.S. theaters so, go check it out. Reviewed by Michelle C., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

1072,0.0,"I don't get what is supposed to be art or dribble as the aforementioned title suggests it is. Maybe it's because of the hype that's being generated along with the apparent controversy tagged along with it. Or what. But I truly despise this film. Why? Because it lacks cohesion as characters are introduced and then suddenly disappear without warning(with the sole exception of the main character).

1075,0.0,"Thrillers often exist in a half-world of their own, with plot contrivances which serve no purpose other than to advance the plot to its conclusion. They rarely feel organic and thought out, existing for their own sake. \""Oldboy,\"" a Korean revenge thriller, is one of those rare gems in which every plot point is part of an overall whole, not only advancing the plot but doing so in a logical manner that also rings true emotionally. For doing so, it won the Grand Prix at Cannes in 2004. Dae-Su Oh (Min-Sik Choi) is a ne'er-do-well, an alcoholic who cheats on his wife compulsively and while on an epic bender, spends his daughter's birthday raving in a police lockup. Bailed out by his friend No-Joo Hwan (Dae-Han Ji), he goes to a telephone booth to call his daughter - and disappears, leaving only his pathetic present of angel wings behind. He wakes up in what appears to be a seedy hotel room, imprisoned behind locked doors; he is fed and cared for, once in awhile after a sprightly tune is played over unseen speakers, he is gassed, and attendants clean him up as well as his room. 15 years pass. He learns that his wife has been murdered and fingerprints and bloodstains found at the scene have led the police to believe that he is the killer. His daughter has been adopted by Swedish foster parents. Even if he escapes, he would be a wanted man, hunted by the authorities, but escape consumes him. He needs to know why he has been imprisoned, and who has done this to him. He desperately tunnels out of his room with a stray chopstick, but just before he would escape from his run-down prison, he is released, left with his journals, a wallet filled with cash, a stylish suit and a cell phone. He eventually discovers that he has a time limit to find out the answers to his questions, or someone he loves will die. But the question he should be asking is not why was he imprisoned, but why was he released. The acting, while occasionally over-the-top, rings true in most cases. The love interest Mido (Hye-Jyong Kang) is lustrous and willing to sacrifice everything, even if she doesn't quite understand why. Oh's obsession and rage are well-played by Choi; while Western tastes would find his work un-subtle, there is an emotional realism to his performance. Director Chan-Wook Park wisely makes his hero extremely flawed, leaping to disastrous conclusions and more-or-less muddling through the puzzle more than anything. He occasionally gets into fights, but is no fighter; whenever he fights, he tends to get his rear end kicked as much as anything. Still, he soldiers on, his need for vengeance exceeding his common sense. When his questions finally do get answered, his whole world - and the audience's expectations - will get turned around on it's ear. This is definitely not for squeamish viewers. There are scenes of torture and mayhem that made me turn away from the screen. There are also many humorous vignettes, keeping the film from drowning in darkness. For anyone, this is an outstanding film that deserves mainstream attention. See the original before the American remake comes out in 2006; no doubt the storyline will be \""Hollywood-ized\"" beyond all recognition.","['""Oldboy,"" is a revenge thriller set in a run-down hotel room in korea. director Chan-Wook park wisely makes his hero extremely flawed. there are scenes of torture and mayhem that made me turn away from the screen.']","['thrillers often exist in a half - world of their own, with plot contrivances which serve no purpose other than to advance the plot to its conclusion. they rarely feel constitutional and thought out, existing for their own sake. \\ "" oldboy, \\ "" a korean revenge thriller, is one of those literary gems in which every plot point is part of an overall whole, not only attempting to plot but doing so in a logical manner that also rings true emotionally. for doing so, it won the festival prix at cannes in 2004. ji - su oh ( min - sik choi ) is a ne\'er - do - well, an alcoholic who cheats on his wife daughter\'s birthday raving in a police lockup. bailed out by his friend no - joo hwan ( dae - han ji ), he goes to a telephone booth to call his daughter - and disappears, leaving but his pathetic present of angel wings behind. he wakes up in what appears to be a seedy hotel room, imprisoned behind locked doors ; he is fed and cared for, once in awhile after a sprightly tune is played over unseen speakers, he is gassed, and attendants clean him up as well as his room. 15 years pass. he learns that his wife has been murdered and fingerprints and bloodstains found at the scene have led the police to believe that he is the killer. his daughter has been adopted by swedish stephen collins foster parents. even if he escapes, he would be a wanted man, hunted by the authorities, but escape consumes him. he needs to know why one has been imprisoned, and what has done this to him. he desperately tunnels out of his room with a stray chopstick, but just before he would escape from his run - down prison, he is released, left collecting his journals, a wallet filled with cash, a stylish suit and a cell phone. he eventually discovers that he has a time limit to find out the answers to his questions, or someone he loves will die. but the question he should be asking is not why was he imprisoned, but why was he released. the acting, while occasionally over - the - top, rings true in most cases. the love interest mido ( hye - jyong jung ) is lustrous and willing to sacrifice everything, even if she doesn\'t quite understand why. oh\'erotic obsession and rage are well - played by choi ; while western tastes would find his work un - subtle, there is an emotional realism to his performance. director chan - wook park wisely makes his hero extremely flawed, leaping to disastrous conclusions and more - or - less muddling through the puzzle more than anything. he occasionally gets into fights, but is no fighter ; whenever he fights, he tends to get his rear end kicked as much as anything. still, he soldiers on, his need for vengeance exceeding his common sense. when his questions finally do get answered, his whole world - and the audience\'siemens arithmetic mean - will get turned round on it\'s ear. this is definitely not for squeamish viewers. there are scenes of torture and mayhem that made me turn away from the screen. there are also many humorous vignettes, keeping the film from drowning in darkness. for anyone, this is an outstanding film that deserves mainstream attention. see the original before the american remake comes out in 2006 ; no doubt the storyline will be \\ "" hollywood - ized \\ "" beyond all recognition.']"

1110,0.0,"It begins in the spring of 1992. A young artist named Ajla (Zana  Marjanovi\u0107) makes herself pretty for her boyfriend, a cop named Danijel  (Goran Kosti\u0107), who she meets up with at an intimate nightclub in  Sarajevo. At this point, we know virtually nothing about them, apart  from the fact that they're in love. But as the music slows and the two  embrace for a romantic dance, a bomb destroys the club, killing some  and critically wounding others. As far as the plot is concerned, the  Bosnian War has suddenly started. In reality, tensions had been  mounting for years following the economic decline of Yugoslavia, which  acted as a buffer zone between westernized Europe and the Soviet Union.  The 1980 death of President Josip Broz Tito didn't help matters much,  for he was no longer able to maintain the unity he created between the  Bosniaks, the Serbs, and the Croats, the country's three largest  religious and ethnic groups.  At first glance, \""In the Land of Blood and Honey\"" seems to be ignoring  these broad historical facts. But the more we watch scene after scene  of violence and bloodshed, the more we realize that first time  writer/director Angelina Jolie is in fact educating us. It's merely a  question of method; rather than explain the Bosnian War with cold  academic detachment, she instead narrows in and humanizes it. From the  images of shell bombings and gunfights to the human atrocities of  ethnic cleansing and mass rape, we're not spared the horrors of this  conflict. Jolie, well known for her humanitarian efforts, made it a  point to cast actors from the Bosnia and Herzegovina area, allowed them  to speak their native language, and even involved them in the screen  writing process. It's no wonder, then, that this aspect of the story  feels the most authentic.  But the film is equal parts war story and tragic romance, and it's the  latter part that I find myself questioning. In the same narrative  tradition as \""Romeo and Juliet,\"" the love story between Ajla and  Danijel is challenged by the opposing ideologies of their respective  peoples. Only after the nightclub bombing and the country's descent  into chaos do we learn that Ajla is a Bosniak and Danijel is a Serb.  Popular opinion dictates that they should hate each other. Not long  after the war starts, Ajla is part of large a group of Bosniak women  arrested and taken to a prisoner-of-war camp; as it so happens, the  place is run by Danijel, now a captain in the Serbian Army. Many of the  women are repeatedly raped, but Ajla, through Danijel's influence, is  left untouched. She is, however, still required to do degrading menial  tasks such as serve the soldiers' food.  As time marches ahead toward 1995, the year the war ended, Ajla and  Danijel will repeatedly reenter each other's lives and assert their  love for one another, albeit under emotionally draining circumstances.  If they wish to continue seeing one another, for example, she must  allow herself to be locked in a cell, presumably to pose as one of his  political prisoners. I grant you, it's a spacious cell, and not too  many prisoners are privileged enough to continue what they love doing \u0096  painting, in Ajla's case. But a cell is still a cell; her love does not  grant her any degree of freedom. It certainly does nothing for the  other women being held prisoner, nor does it spare her sister, Lejla  (Vanessa Glodjo), from enduring the greatest pain a woman in her  position will ever know.  As well acted as this subplot is, much of it feels contrived, as if  created solely for the purpose of being dramatic. Having said that,  aspects of it are compelling, none more so than the extent to which  conflict and injustice can traumatize people. As the film progresses,  it becomes increasingly apparent that the bond Ajla and Danijel formed  prior to the war is breaking. At a certain point, it was no longer  clear to me how they truly felt for one another; they both seem torn  between what they once had and the reality of the current situation,  spurred by long-standing ethnic tensions. Danijel in particular is  weak-minded when confronted with his father, the Serbian general  Neboj\u009aa Vukojevi\u0107 (Rade \u008aerbed\u009eija), who, following the slaughter of  his family at the hands of the Turks, has absolutely no tolerance for  Muslims. Danijel may not be as impartial as he initially thought.  There's much to admire about \""In the Land of Blood and Honey.\"" Not too  many first-time directors would have the fortitude to write a  screenplay for a war film, shoot it in distant foreign locations, hire  local actors, and stage elaborate action sequences that require days if  not weeks to prepare. From a technical standpoint, Jolie has risen to  the challenge. She also deserves praise from a historical standpoint,  for she has brought our attention back to a conflict the world in  general has largely forgotten. Amazing such a thing could happen, given  the fact that not even twenty years has passed. From a narrative  standpoint, on the other hand, there's room for improvement.

1142,0.0,"************SPOILER****** O.K. people, I will admit right here, right now, I simply LOVED the books. I have read them all several times and I was genuinely excited at the prospect of MY book coming to life on the big screen. I went to the movie theater with my die hard Twilight friends, expecting to be amazed. Well, I was amazed all right. But definitely not in a good way. The scene starts out with Bella( Kristen Stewart) leaving for the airport with her mother. For some strange reason, her carry on item is a potted cactus plant. The scene them melts into a birds eye view of the beautiful Washington mountains(helped along by whinny, annoying, indie rock music). As Bella comes to terms with her new life(narrated by the mannish voiced Stewart), Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner, wearing a dead ferret on his head) arrives with his father and their old, Bella's new, truck. The only thing they got right in this scene was the truck for crying out loud! In the book, Charlie(Billy Burke) is not on speaking terms with Billy because of his prejudicial dislike for the Cullen clan; however, in the movie, the two men joke and laugh and have a grand old time. Meanwhile, Bella and Jacob make forced conversation, never quite looking at each other(even though in the book, they don't meet until very much later). Stewart's forced smiles, bad acting, and foul mood completely ruin the scene. We then move on to the 'first sight' of the Cullen clan. I shouldn't even comment. The characters come in-slow motion of course-in pairs, each arm and arm with his/her own lover. Lets start with Rosalie(Nikki Reed). Reed is short(Reed wore awkward, six- inch heels she couldn't even walk in), very tan(can you say, pasty make- up?), with brown hair(Reed was unwilling to dye it, so she wore an ill fitting wig), moles, and an all around ugly face. The choice for her role was made solely because of the director's relationship with Reed. The real Rosalie-as stated in the book-is tall, statuesque, with golden blond hair, very pale, and beautiful-all in all, the complete opposite of Reed. I honestly like the choice for Emmett, except I wished Kellan Lutz beefed up a bit more. Alice was too tall, but otherwise I had no problem with Ashley Greene(she could have lost a little weight though- just saying). Now, Jackson Rathbone as Jasper would have been fine, if the guy could act. He took the phrase 'hungry enough to eat a horse' way too literally. He had a pinched, grotesque look on his face for the whole of the movie. Finally, ah, Edward, how will I begin? Well, Robert Pattinson looked the part, if not a little too skinny, but oh, ah, ugh, the make-up! What on earth were these people thinking? You could tell he was wearing a gallon of make-up, but they ran out of it when the reached his Adam's Apple. Edward also, apparently, loves the new strawberry Cover Girl wet slicks lip gloss. Now, onto the biology lab. What to say, what to say. Well I recommend, Vampires Suck. The people there displayed Pattinson's reaction to Bella's scent perfectly. In the book, it merely states that Edward goes rigid in his seat, glaring at Bella with hate filled eyes as she walked past him. Past him. Not Bella walking in front of a fan-slow motion, once again- with her mouth opened suggestively. And Edward DID NOT slap his hand to his face, hiding his nose from someone who farted near by. And I don't remember Edward trying not to cry in the book either(his 'I'm trying really hard not to cry' face reappeared throughout the movie). Well, I am bored now, so I wont bore anyone else with the rest of my review for the most terrible, poorly written, directed,acted, etc, movie in a decade. The indie film feel with Stewart grabbing at her hair, jutting her chin out, shaking her head(you'd think she was a dog), and stuttering makes you want to stalk out of the theater to go shriek at the manager for your money back. Stewart and Pattinson's chemistry is non-existent in this poorly adapted, haphazardly written, laughably acted atrocity of a film.","['the movie is a haphazardly written, laughably acted atrocity of a film. the movie stars adam lancaster, rachel weiss, emma watson and sam taylor.']","[""* * * * * * * * * * * * spoiler * * * * * * o. k. people, i will admit right here, right now, i simply loved the books. i have read them all several times and i was genuinely excited at the prospect of my book coming to life on the big screen. i went to the movie theater with my die and twilight friends, expecting to be amazed. well, i was amazed all right. but really not in a good way. the scene starts out with bella ( kristen stewart ) leaving for the airport with her mother. for some strange reason, her carry on item is a potted cactus plant. the scene them melts into a birds eye view, annoying, indie rock music ). as bella comes to terms with her new life ( narrated by the mannish voiced stewart ), jacob black ( taylor lautner, wearing a dead ferret on his head ) arrives with his father and their old, bella's new, truck. the only thing they got right in this scene was the truck for crying out loud! in the book, charlie ( billy burke ) is not on speaking terms with billy because of his prejudicial dislike for the cullen clan ; however, in the movie, the two men joke and laugh and have a grand old time. meanwhile, blake and jacob make friendly conversation, never quite looking at each other ( even though in my book, they don't meet until very much later ). stewart's forced smiles, bad acting, and foul mood completely ruin the scene. we then move on towards the'first appearance'of the cullen clan. you shouldn't even comment. the characters travel in - slow motion of course - in pairs, each arm and arm with his / her own lover. lets start with rosalie ( nikki reed ). reed is short ( reed wore awkward, six - inch heels she couldn't even walk in ), very tan ( can you say, pasty make - up? ), with brown hair ( reed was unwilling to dye it, so she wore an ill fitting wig ), moles, and an all around ugly face. the choice for her role was made solely because of the director's relationship with reed. the real rosalie - as stated in the book - looks tall, statuesque, with golden blond hair, very pale, and beautiful - all in all, the complete opposite of reed. i honestly like the choice for emmett, except i wished kellan lutz beefed up a bit more. alice was too tall, but otherwise i had no problem with ashley greene ( she could have lost a little weight though - just saying ). now, jackson rathbone as jasper would have been fine, if the guy could act. he took the phrase'hungry enough to eat a horse'way too literally. he had a pinched, grotesque look on his face for the whole of the movie. finally, ah, edward, how will i begin? well, robert pattinson looked the part, if not a little too skinny, but oh, ah, ugh, the make - up! what on earth were these the great unwashed thinking? you could tell he was wearing a gallon of make - up, but they ran out of it when the reached his adam's apple. edward also, apparently, loves the new strawberry cover girl wet slicks lip gloss. now, onto the biology lab. what to say, what to say. well i recommend, vampires suck. the people there expose pattinson's reaction to bella's scent perfectly. in the book, it merely states that edward goes rigid in his seat, glaring at bella with hate filled eyes as she walked past him. past him. not bella walking in front of a fan - slow motion, once again - with her mouth opened suggestively. and edward did not slap his hand to his face, hiding his nose from someone who farted near by. and i don't remember edward trying not to cry in the book either ( his'i'm try really hard not to cry'face reappeared throughout the movie ). well, i am bored now, so i wont bore anyone else with the rest of my review for the nigh terrible, poorly written, directed, acted, etc, movie in a decade. the indie film feel with stewart grabbing at her hair, jutting her chin extinct, shaking her head ( you'd think she was a dog ), and stuttering makes you want to stalk out of the theater to go shriek at the manager for your money back. stewart and pattinson's chemistry is non - existent in this poorly adapted, haphazardly written, laughably acted atrocity of a film.""]"

I know he is 'Dark' and all in this film but it sounds too forced and he actually sounds like a Villain.* Maggie Gyllenhaal. Is it me or after watching this film I longed for Katie Holmes? Maggie isn't the the sort of woman men fight over... she is one lucky girl to have Bruce Wayne and Harvey Dent after her. Must have a good personality?? * Heath! Scared me with his antics. Where Jack was more for gags in the original Batman, Heath takes it to another level of insanity. He sounded a bit like a demented Andy Warhol but I thought he did a great job and admit I (along with the rest of the viewers)were always excited to see him popping up in scenes.*Plot holes. Many of them here but that is why it's a movie and I let them slip.* Sound - There are at least 3 or 4 scenes where this piercing noise gets louder and it causes suspense. After the first 2 scenes with it I liked it but thought it was over done on the 4th and 5th go. I can't see Dark Knight soundtracks flying off shelves.* Length - 2 and a half hours. May I just say I was at my seat at 9.30 and it was 12.20 when I left the cinema. I think I should have had a coffee before I went in as I lost interest at some stages in the film (when they were trying to fill us in on storyline, just for the sake of linking the film with the previous one and I am sure, future films).* Harvey Dent flicking a coin - Very NO Country for Old Men. I thought it was a bit early to have another character who decides peoples fate with a flick of a coin.* Nurse Joker - Very left field but I liked it. Was demented to see him as a Nurse. Joker walking away from the hospital blowing it up was classic. Also the scene before it when Harvey Dent is in the hospital, thought it was good to see Joker explain himself to Harvey (now looking very two faced).* Maggie Gyllenhaal - When Joker drops her from the building at the party for Harvey Dent. batman flies down to save her and they land on a taxi. She is almost smiling and talking to him as if nothing happened. I expected her to be out of breath or freaking out. Check it out, you'll know what I mean.Overall, I'd give this film 6.5 out of 10.

It exposes how dogma is created and manipulated. It tries to balance politics with personal drama, and how sometimes compromises are reached, with the respective parties' personal agendas being more important than faith itself.

It exposes various points of views, and it shows how easy it is for empires to crumble, when the right personality is willing to step in and take chances to manipulate the populace. It is truly scary as we see some intelligent individuals give in, seeing in their eyes, that survival might more important than fighting injustice and pure greed for power, especially when the numbers are skewed. There are a couple of moments in this film when you can't help but shake with anger as injustices are happening in front of us and we can't make a move to correct the situation.Unlike what I have seen in a couple of reviews, I think the performances here are truly interesting and very charismatic, in particular Weisz, as the very intelligent philosopher who can't believe what she is witnessing and never surrenders her integrity, even when she is posed with a very good offer who would have allowed her at least the opportunity to buy some time. The rest of the cast is almost as good, as each man in her life shows a different side of human nature and through their own interpretation and appreciation of her powerful presence, show that she is indeed a remarkable force.In addition to the important themes we see throughout the film, we are dealing with an epic, a film unlike the big spectacles of the 50's and 60's, except this one has very strong foundations, but it's impossible not to be awed by the recreation of a long, lost era, as we see some of the marvels of the ancient world, some truly accurate costumes, and some impressive art direction.

It portrayed the main character as being a hero for wanting to blow up something/ anything as long as there was innocent people involved. His wife who was a waste of a character added very little to the film. Her most note worthy contribution to the plot was to encourage her husband to get back in to terrorism once he had turned his back on this life. She proclaims he was much more fun when he was trying to blow him self up. It is hard to believe any wife would encourage her lover to go and kill him self leaving her and a young child at home to fend for them selves.For a supposed comedy it offered few if any laugh out loud moments the exception being when one of the main characters blows him self up.

1205,0.0,"I saw an advance screening of Man of Steel. I honestly wasn't extremely excited about this movie because I've been a fan of Superman my entire life and I've seen every rendition of his beginnings. And I was right not to be excited. Spoiler alert: If you are at least 35 years old, you've seen this movie before. It was called \""Superman\"" and it starred Christopher Reeves and was released in 1978. Then you saw this movie again. It was called \""Superman II\"" and it also starred Christopher Reeves and was released in 1980. You've also seen it on \""Smallville\"" if you were a fan of that show. The difference with this film is the names in the credits are more star studded and Christopher Nolan has incorporated his dark imagination into how it looks. Much like Nolan did with the Batman franchise, he has made everything dark and dreary, which doesn't really help when it is viewed in 3D. Many of the scenes are also full of oddly shaped depictions of what Kryptonians would fly in, or on, which I assume Nolan incorporated because we wouldn't expect them or notice them. For example, the phallus shaped mechanisms used to transport Zod and his cohorts into the Phantom Zone looked a lot like what I keep in my bedroom nightstand for lonely nights. But I digress. On the upside, the action sequences were cool and full of CGI which was completely expected. Nolan and Snyder do action well. This was also a more violent depiction of the origin story with some unusual twists from the Superman myth we have grown to love. Obviously Nolan and Goyer were impatient and wanted Lois and Clark to meet and fall in love at first sight, with Lois having the full knowledge of who Clark was before he became her coworker at the Daily Planet. In Nolan's world, Lois will be playing dumb the entire time she works with Clark at the Daily Planet and Clark isn't trying to keep his identity a secret from her. That kind of takes some of the romanticism away from the original story we have grown to love. Not to mention, what was the hurry? Since it has already been said that Nolan will not be on board for the highly anticipated and long overdue \""Justice League\"" movie expected to be released some time in my lifetime I hope, I couldn't help but wonder what was the entire point in redoing this particular story again. A classic is a classic for a reason. With so many other adventures Superman experienced battling other villains, Nolan and Goyer could have written something other than Superman versus Zod version 2013. I don't understand why DC chose to green light this film. I truly believe DC is grasping desperately for a huge box office hit so that they can feel better standing next to their rival, Marvel Comics, who has been whipping out movies like magicians pulling scarves out of their hats ever since they partnered with Disney. DC choosing to rewrite and reintroduce the same three DC Universe characters (Superman, Batman and Green Lantern) twice each (not counting the animated versions) in the last 35 years is just becoming redundant. The next Superman movie should be based on a different part of the series if DC wants a box office hit. True Superman fans know his origin, regardless of their age. Since Nolan and Goyer weren't even true to some of those details 100% (the age Clark first starting feeling his abilities was 13 but Nolan made him younger and Jonathan Kent died in a tornado in the film instead of from a heart attack), why not create something fresh instead of something recycled? I wouldn't see this movie in theaters if I had to pay for it. I definitely wouldn't pay the extra dollars to watch it in 3D. Man of Steel can definitely wait for Netflix. By the way, if you don't like my review because I didn't fall for the very clever marketing of Man of Steel which makes you believe it's going to be an awesome experience, don't message me debating with me about it.

1230,0.0,"A truly disappointing film, that in no way makes up for the lackluster final two seasons of a once great TV show.

What's the point?) Everyone except David Duchovny, who tries his best to introduce some passion and humour into a film markedly devoid of it otherwise, and an underused but great Billy Connolly, is just doing this on autopilot. Particularly bad is a career-worst Gillian Anderson as Scully- the formerly capable and clever scientist now only comes across as a strident, argumentative,whiny roadblock for Mulder to overcome, which she never was in the TV show, and which makes their re-kindled love affair as unbelievable(and unwelcome) as it was in the series. Anderson's whole performance is so...unwilling... that she might as well be wearing a tee-shirt reading \""I Do Not Want To Be Here\"". As for the lame \""paranormal\"" goings on- shady Russian Doctors experimenting with severed limbs would have been a great place to reintroduce the sorely missed Alex Krycek to the franchise, but instead we get a tired (and quite offensive to Gay folk) subplot involving married,Gay psychopaths.

1234,0.0,"This danish movie is very similar to the far superior movie \""Black Book\"", which also focused on people who suffered from the constant threat of the German occupation. While the latter one had a three dimensional heroine, a mature and suspenseful plot and believable action and sex in it, the danish version falls flat on its face in every aspect of film-making. This isn't due to a minimal budget and it certainly can't be blamed on the actors, which all had good performances in their careers.Despite the fact, that this movie is based on true events, you never really care about the two main characters.

Did reeves do a good job in preserving the original? did he adapt the novel instead of the movie like he promised the author?...well no.the movie opens the Eli's (abby)caregiver (Haken) was sent to the hospital after pouring acid on his face. Over this, we hear a soundtrack sounded a little too familiar with the original soundtrack. the cop character that was in the book but not the original movie came in and quoted one line from the book...and thats about the only thing Reeves added in the movie from the book that wasn't in the original. the rest are either shot for shot images from the movie or scenes that aren't from either book or original. now of course just because it's not copying from both book or movie doesn't entirely mean it can be bad. but it takes a good director to make it good (carpenter the thing...) This is where the subtlety comes in. What i loved about the original movie and book was that there was no defining moment, it kept making you think, there was no distinction between good and evil. Osker (owen)'s tormentors were like any other bully we dealt with in school, these new kids are on borderline homicidal. in the movie, there was a line from romero and juliet, in this movie, we get the kids watching a scene from a movie of romero and juliet, osker is shown reading the book for school, and this is mentioned three other times. Eli attacking became hilarious in this. in the book and movie she attacked with little fighting involved. now we get a horrible cgi eli (we see cgi eli about 3 other times) climbing all over people like a freakin monkey. Eli's appearance is over the top too, in the movie and book, she changed slightly with brighter eyes and sunken cheeks.

1254,0.0,"When I first heard that Disney was working on an adaptation of \""Rapunzel,\"" I was undoubtedly excited. The classic Brothers Grimm tale has always been among my favorite stories, right next to \""Hansel and Gretel,\"" \""Prince Swan,\"" and \""Brother and Sister.\"" I was even more enthusiastic when I heard that it was going to be the most beautiful film Disney had ever made. During its \""Rapunzel: Unbraided\"" phase, I started becoming apprehensive, clearly fearing (as most others did) that the film was going to be a Dreamworks rip-off.My fears eventually died down and turned to joy once again when it was retitled \""Rapunzel\"" and had the traditional leads of Rapunzel and Prince Bastion. An online interview with one of the animators I read spoke of how Bastion was the classic prince from the fairy tale who had a basset hound that pranced around his heels. More concept artwork emerged, making me count down the days until \""Rapunzel\"" finally premiered. I didn't know until much later that Glen Keane suffered a heart attack and passed direction of the film to Nathan Greno and Byron Howard. When they changed the title to \""Tangled\"" and changed the prince's name to \""Prince Flynn,\"" my feelings wavered a bit, but then I told myself that the changes weren't *that* bad. It was only when they changed Flynn to a common thief named \""Flynn Rider\"" whose personality was a blatant rip-off of Prince Naveen's (\""The Princess and the Frog\"") did I became angry and apprehensive more than ever before.The marketing did nothing to bolster my confidence in the film, nor did it do so for anyone else. I spoke strong opinions of my utter hatred for \""Tangled,\"" but was accused multiple times of judging it before I'd seen it. I went into \""Tangled\"" with a grudgingly open mind and came out as disappointed as I always knew I'd be. The animation was beautiful, but it wasn't the \""moving oil painting\"" look we'd been promised. I'm also sure other studios could replicate the same look if they wanted to. A lot of the music was just as beautiful, but Rapunzel's opening song \""When Will My Life Begin?\"" reminded me of an 80s sitcom for some reason, as well as something out of \""Shrek.\"" As long as I'm mentioning \""Shrek,\"" the second reprisal of said song was eerily similar to the Princess Fiona and bird scene from the first \""Shrek\"" film. The only good songs \""Tangled\"" had going for it were \""Kingdom Dance\"" (a lively medieval tune) and \""I See the Light\"" (reminiscent of \""A Whole New World\"" from \""Aladdin\"").I didn't laugh at any point because I found the film's humor to be corny and like that of \""Shrek.\"" Calling the tavern \""The Snuggly Duckling?\"" What kind of name is that? The only characters I found I could like were Rapunzel and her chameleon sidekick, Pascal (I finally found out where his name came from, which I thought was very clever). He's the most adorable sidekick to date. Maximus looked like a mash between the horse from \""The Road to El Dorado,\"" Samson (\""Sleeping Beauty\""), and Achilles (\""The Hunchback of Notre Dame\""). He also acted like Scooby Doo with his sniffing along the ground like a dog. The idea of a \""cop horse\"" was also not funny. Mother Gothel looked like a cross between Janet Jackson and Cher, actually creeping me out. Obviously, my biggest complaint was that Flynn was changed from a prince into a thief. The character of Rapunzel's prince is among my favorite in the Brothers Grimm stories, and it ticked me off that they lowered him to such a pitiful and unoriginal character.Disney can deny it all they want, but they made the changes they did because they didn't think boys would want to watch another \""Princess\"" film. Since when did they care what we guys thought? Everything out today is either \""Disney Princess\"" or \""Disney Fairies.\"" If they *really* cared about attracting a male audience, they should have worked on that \""Disney Heroes\"" line they had going years ago, or make a film based solely on a male protagonist or a gender-neutral film. They shouldn't have used a beautiful fairy tale like \""Rapunzel\"" to do it. And while I'm on the subject, where's the boys' merchandise? I haven't seen a single male-oriented \""Tangled\"" toy on the shelves yet! I can only give \""Tangled\"" two stars out of ten: one star for good animation, the other for good music. Everything else just ruined this once promising film. If it'd remained more faithful to the original story, then I'm sure this could very well have been Disney's crowning achievement. Their final product can hardly be compared to such classics like \""The Little Mermaid\"" and \""Beauty and the Beast.\"" If anything, it's more like \""Shrek\"" or \""How to Train Your Dragon.\"" My hopes have shifted to the company's newest fairy tale film, \""Brave,\"" which I hope will make up for what \""Tangled\"" lacks.

1266,0.0,"First I had to contemplate whether this rating would have a \""spoiler\""... It was a tough decision, because that would imply that there's some sort of plot line that I may ruin inadvertently... rest assured, there isn't. I mean we knew Bella and Edward were getting married, and the previews showed there may be a baby in the works, and well, there you have it. But after sitting through this.... thing....for two hours, I thought that I simply MUST write a review. I haven't felt this motivated and energized to write a review in ages! I simply had to start typing as soon as I got home! My goal: to stop just one person from seeing this film. If I do, I will have done my good deed on this earth, and my work on this planet would be done. I know, it's such a minor thing, but hey, it's the little things that count.The movie starts by a few excusable facial closeups as we see one actor after the next sigh, or smile, or look wistfully or longingly here and there, while the camera lingers on them 30 seconds too long; sometimes with a sarcastic smile which says \""I'm really sad inside, but I'm putting on a brave face for you\"", or a mirthless smile that says: \""I'm thinking about a grilled cheese sandwich right now, but I'll just smile and look past you to give the impression that I'm really deeply moved by what you're saying\"". Now and then the REALLY good actors get to throw in a little knowing crooked half smile to add some REAL gravity to the scene! I could only imagine what deep ironic thoughts they must have been projecting, but alas, it's one of those things that if you have to ask, you're just not cool enough to know. Well! Just when you think you've seen every possible mellow dramatic look and cheesy music combo possible... the director decides to do it again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and just when you thought it couldn't possibly happen again, it does! And then again, and again, and again, .... Oh, and once in a while the director gets in his helicopter and does a senseless nature flyover scene just to break things up a little, and to get a way from the set.Since I had lots of time during the film to contemplate life, the universe, and everything while I listened to the cheesiest musical scores to ever accompany a film while actors sulked, and stomped, and pouted, glared, and tried to out-overact each other, I wondered, why would this director resort to this inanity? It then hit me! The entire plot could easily be filmed in 30 minutes, and he had a whole hour and a bit to fill! I then empathized with the director as I imagined his moment of panic... it must have been a spot of genius when he realized he could fill the rest of the film with meaningless nature shot after nature shot, and the above-mentioned \""let's throw in another drawn out look\"" scenes. At various points in the film I drifted, and started to fantasize that sudden weird things would happen to change up the deadening tempo to spice up the film: like Bella would trip over her wedding gown, or Edward and Jacob would profess their love for each other and leave Bella to quiver lip herself into oblivion on her own while nobody cared, but sadly nothing like this happened to save the day. There was one saving grace, I must say. Even though the theatre was filled with teenage girls, about halfway through the film, one, then another, then another started to laugh out loud! Pretty soon those of us who weren't comatose or brain-dead, joined in. It was something akin to a Christmas miracle! It was just like it happened in Whoville when everyone started to sing together! We the brave, and the few, in our darkest hour, we came together in laughter, and through our laughter whispered to one another: \""it's OK, we're in this together, we can make it\""! And we did. When you get to the very end of the film, there's this nail-biter to end all nail-biters.... you'll go through five to ten minutes of nail biting dramatic mastery, there's changing camera angles, and zoom ins, and zoom outs, and music, and really really bad effects ... all inching towards the final finale and the answer you must know: will she live, or is she dead? Don't worry, I won't spoil it, the real spoiler is this: when you get there, you just... won't... care!

1298,0.0,"&lt;Spoilers ahead&gt;I had heard that this was a wonderful piece of animation and a truly creative and imaginative story, and in that regard this movie does not disappoint much, although I have little appreciation for anime. However, it seems to me the film is lacking in some of the basics of cinema. There is little plot or character development, serious lack of continuity, plotlines left dangling, situations resolved far too tidily, etc. At one point Kamajii tells Chihiro that, rather conveniently for her, he has been hanging on to some train tickets for 40 years. Why?? Where was he planning to go? Why didn't he use them in all that time? Why is he now so willing to hand them over to Chihiro without a moment's hesitation? There were countless examples of this sort of thing throughout the film. After experiencing No-Face's devastation of the bathhouse, Chihiro just walks out ahead of him and says matter-of-factly that he just got a little crazy in the bathhouse - reminded me of a scene in Monty Python's Holy Grail (except the scene in Holy Grail was funny). At the end of the film, Chihiro has little trouble determining that her parents are not among the pigs shown to her, although earlier in the film she could not pick them out in a dream. If you're going to put foreshadowing in a film, you ought to follow up on it and not just ignore it! Chihiro falls in love with Haku (vital to developments in the film) despite having spent only about 10 minutes with him (some of which he spent being nasty to her), despite the fact that she has been told that he is not to be trusted, and despite the fact that she has proof that he has stolen in the service of Yubaba. I know this is a movie, and a fantasy at that, but I need some reason to believe that she might have fallen in love with him, not just some other character stating that it is so. Haku, mortally wounded as a dragon and now back to being a boy, inexplicably recovers and is well enough to fly to Zeniba's house; again somewhat reminiscent of a scene from Holy Grail (\""I got better\""). I could go on with other criticisms of the film, but I could be here all night if I really got started.To me, this film was simply a collection of well-animated fantasy pieces strung together to fill out 2 hours. And, to be honest with you, while the backgrounds were incredibly drawn, I didn't think the movement was anything special. It wasn't particularly funny, exciting, or interesting. I spent most of the movie thinking that there must be a tremendous gap in my understanding of Japanese culture, theology, and mythology that would have helped me to better appreciate it. Upon reflection, however, I think that no amount of cultural sensitivity could have made up for what was simply poor film- making. I concede the posssibility that, as suggested by some at this site, the English dubbed version that I saw is far inferior to the Japanese version with subtitles. However, I am not willing to waste yet another 2 hours of my life that I will never get back to find out if that is the case.","[""the film was simply a collection of well-animated fantasy pieces strung together to fill out 2 hours. it wasn't particularly funny, exciting, or interesting.""]","['& lt ; spoilers ahead & gt ; i had heard that this was a wonderful piece of animation and a truly creative and imaginative story, and in that regard this movie does not disappoint much, although i have little appreciation for anime. however, it seems to me the film is lacking in some of the basics of cinema. there is little plot or character evolution, serious lack of continuity, plotlines left dangling, situations resolved far too tidily, etc. at one point kamajii tells chihiro that, rather conveniently for her, he has been hanging on to some train tickets for 40 years. why?? where was he planning to go? why didn\'t he buy them in all that much? why is she now so willing to hands them over to chihiro without a moment\'s hesitation? there were countless examples of this sort of thing throughout the film. after experiencing no - face\'s devastation of the bathhouse, chihiro just walks out ahead of him and says matter - of - factly that he simply got a little crazy in the bathhouse - reminded me of a scene in monty python\'s holy holy grail ( except the scene in holy grail was funny ). at the end of the film, chihiro has little trouble determining that her parents are not among the pigs shown to her, although earlier in the film she could not pick them out in a dream. if you\'re going to put foreshadowing into a film, you ought to follow up against it and not just ignore it! chihiro falls in love with haku ( vital to developments in the film ) despite having spent only about 10 minutes with him ( some of which he spent being nasty to her ), despite the fact that she has been told that he is not to be trusted, and despite the fact that she has proof that he has stolen in the service of yubaba. i know this is this movie, and a fantasy at that, but we need some reason to believe that she might have fallen in love with him, not just some other character stating that it is thus. haku, mortally ill as a dragon and now back to being a boy, inexplicably recovers and is well enough to fly to zeniba\'s mansion ; again somewhat reminiscent of a scene from holy grail ( \\ "" i got better \\ "" ). i could go on with other criticisms of the film, but i could be here all night if i really got started. to me, this film was simply a collection of well - animated fantasy pieces strung together to fill out 2 hours. and, to be honest with you, while the backgrounds were incredibly drawn, i didn\'t think the movement was anything special. it wasn\'t particularly funny, exciting, or interesting. i spent most of the movie thinking that there must be a tremendous gap in my understanding of japanese culture, theology, and mythology that would have helped me to better appreciate it. upon reflection, however, i think that no amount of cultural sensitivity could have made up for what was simply, as suggested by some at this site, the english dubbed version that i saw is far inferior to the japanese version with subtitles. however, i am not willing to waste yet another 2 hours of my life that i will never get back to find out if that is the case.']"

1300,0.0,"I love Amy Schumer. I think she's courageous, intelligent and very funny. That is why I am very disappointed in this stinker of a movie. I actually walked out halfway through. I thought, 'do I want to spend two hours of my precious life watching this human waste'? The answer was 'no', so I left. The movie's biggest problem is that it's supposed to be a comedy, but it's not funny. \nDid anyone at the film company watch the film before they released it? Did they laugh? No one in the cinema I was in, was laughing, except possibly at the comical fall off the exercise bike at the start of the movie - Schumer is good at physical comedy.\nI Feel Pretty actually has one or two things to say. We all know people who aren't necessarily beautiful but just breeze through life because they're super-confident. \nThat's what happens to Schumer's character when she mysteriously hits her head and transforms from a painfully insecure website designer to the receptionist at a cosmetics company who thinks she's hot. As shown in the scene where Amy's character picks up a guy in a dry cleaner, often a prospective partner just loves having someone else take charge and ask them on a date.\nMichelle Williams' character, the cosmetics executive, is supposed to represent the super-attractive woman who doesn't have a clue professionally or socially. But this character is too much of a flake to be interesting - she's so squeaky-voiced and delicate she doesn't have any substance. \nAnd what's with Schumer's supposedly ''ugly'' friends?

It's a very common device in US films, when in fact most of the population aren't supermodel perfect in looks, i.e. most people are normal. \nThe movie doesn't seem to know what to do with these friends, although I guess it's the Schumer character who is the obnoxious one.\nI think people are being unkind when they say Schumer's career is going down the toilet.

1303,0.0,"The remake takes the basic plot of the original 1984 film and makes just a few cosmetic changes to it. The main character, instead of a white teenager (named Daniel-san) who moves from Jersey to California, is now a black 12 year-old (named Dre Parker) that moves from Detroit to China. Instead of learning karate from an old Japanese guy, he learns kungfu from Jackie Chan. And you wouldn't be the first to then ask \""why isn't it called the Kungfu kid then?\"" But really, does it matter? The fighting style is different, but the soul of the movie, I'm happy to report, is the same.Something that occurred to me early on was that in the movie poster and opening credits, Jaden Smith gets top billing. Yeah, he's playing the eponymous character and all, and he did a pretty good job in Pursuit of Happiness, but the other guy is Jackie Chan, a legendary superstar in both the Eastern and Western movie scene! There were so many ways where Smith could've gone wrong: he could've easily just played it easy and just been a shallow character throwing Fresh Prince attitude around in an Asian society (like Lil Bow Wow in Tokyo Drift), but he instead channeled a truly frightened and vulnerable little boy. And that's why he earns that top billing.From the opening scene where he and his mother are moving out of Detroit, Smith just sucks you in with his innocence and sweetness. No macho bravado; just a kid who's sad he's leaving his home. And here he sidesteps another landmine \u2013 he could've just been this mopey kid channeling sad puppy-dog eyes for the entire movie like Frodo, but when he meets the cute Chinese girl that snags his heart, the charming Fresh Prince genes in him comes out to play.In the original movie, Daniel-san was a teenager who moved interstate. Smith's character is a kid who moved to a completely different country. As an American kid in China who can barely speak a word of Chinese, he is not only even more isolated, but his age also means he is less able to deal with the dramatic change in lifestyle. He's scared, he's lonely, and you can see this on his face even before the bully makes his entrance and smacks the crap out of him.And here is why Smith is such a good young actor. A lot of actors are afraid to look like scared little wimps on camera because it's not very glam, but Smith goes there. He goes way out there, and you will see on the screen a scared little boy who's barely holding it together. And this is where the movie really works, and this is why Jaden Smith really earns his top billing. Dre Parker is more likable than Daniel-san, and Smith does the scared little boy character so well that your heart will just crack into a hundred pieces for him. Daniel-san fought in that tournament because he's the underdog and he wants to put the bully in his place, but Dre fights because he doesn't want to be afraid anymore. And because of this one key factor, this deeper connection with the protagonist, I think the new film is a lot better than the original, iconic it may be.And as for the fight sequences, it's both brutal and stylish, and not only does it surpass the original in terms of stunt work, but it can really hold its own against other kungfu movies. And these are little kids that are fighting too! I'm not going to spoil it, but wait till you see Jaden Smith's version of the Crane Kick. It's awesome.How does Jackie Chan compare with Pat Morita? Well, Jackie Chan made a career for himself by playing the bumbling clown who can also do crazy stunts. In this movie, he only fights once, and he plays a more subdued and serious role. And while Smith's acting clearly outshines Chan's, it is actually pretty good to see Jackie Chan just play a regular guy. His surrogate father relationship with Smith played out extremely well, and you can see quite a good chemistry between the two. Chan's side-story about his family is one of the weaker parts of the story, but it doesn't detract much from the story.Rounding off the coming-of-age stories in this movie is of course, the love arc involving the Chinese girl. The scenes of Dre trying to Romeo the girl were so funny and sincere that it really didn't feel like fluff in between the cool fight scenes at all. This arc was more than just a reason for Dre to enter the tournament to fight the bully, because the blossoming relationship between the two really showed his character growing from a boy to a young man. It reminded you of childhood innocence, and once again made Smith's character so much more real.The movie is far from perfect though, with a few moments that just pulls you out and makes you go \""what the hell?\"" Like Dre's mother, for example. I don't care how proud of your son you are, but when your boy is getting beat within inches of his life, you don't cheer for him to get up. And while I can buy how good Dre becomes at kungfu under Jackie Chan's tutelage, there are just some things he does in the tournament that are way too impressive and makes you ask \""when did he learn that?\"" But these moments are few and far between, and it only takes you out of the experience for a few seconds before you get back into the exciting ride.When this movie was announced, I didn't think it was necessary to remake the 1984 movie. But now that I've seen it, I'm glad they did because for once, the remake surpasses the sequel.","[""a remake of the 1984 film is released. the movie is based on the original. it's a good movie, but the fight sequences aren't perfect.""]","['the remake takes the basic plot of the original 1984 film and makes just a few cosmetic changes to it. the main character, instead of a white teenager ( named daniel - san ) who goes from jersey to california, is now a black 12 year - old ( as dre parker ) that moves from detroit to china. instead of learning karate from an old japanese guy, he learns kungfu from jackie chan. and you wouldn\'t be the first to then ask \\ "" why isn\'t it called the kungfu kid then?

1329,0.0,"I went to the screening with high hope but was very disappointed for several reasons: 1. The movie is way too long. It added too many uninteresting sub-plots which distracted from the original taut and suspense story. It's confusing and anti-climax. One time during the screening, my friend turned to me and whispered he's lost with what's going on. 2. The movie has a very inconsistent tone to it. From the trailers, most people would think the background of the movie was set a while back, and it said 'Some Years Ago' at the beginning of the movie. However, if you count how many scenes used the compact cell phones and annoying text messaging over and over and over again, then it didn't look right! The mob still acted like mob in 60's but they were using latest cell phones dealing with 'micro-processors'. Eh?! The movie feels and looks like an extra long version of cell phone commercial. What happened to the original nail-biting Morse code tapping scene? 3. The cast has no chemistry! It took me \u00bd hour into the movie to distinguish Leonardo from Matt. The lead actress is very 'ordinary' and not very interesting at all. Jack is Jack, doing his psychotic hybrid of 'Shinning' and 'Joker' from the Batman. Mark Wahlber (who I usually like) was obnoxious! Alec Baldwin thinks he's still in 'Saturday Night Live' doing all the gay jokes. That lefts Martin Sheen very little screen time to gain my sympathy for his character's death.4. The key pivotal scenes were let downs from the original, including the falling body and elevator scene at the end of the movie. It supposed to evoke sadness and shock, not disgust and laughs.

1336,0.0,"In the small town of Forks a series of strange murders has sparked tensions. It becomes apparent that there is a plot to transform ordinary people into newborn vampires, who are unable to think for themselves. At the hands of this scheme is the vampire Victoria who is forging a small army so that she can destroy the Cullen family. The Cullen's seek to form an uneasy alliance with the werewolves, believing that they can only win the battle with their help. This means that Edward (Robert Pattinson) has to learn to work with Jacob (Taylor Lautner), even though they are caught in an awkward love triangle for Bella (Kristen Stewart) and her affection. Edward isn't willing to change Bella into a vampire until they get married and she is not willing to make this kind of commitment as her true feelings for Jacob remain unresolved.The third film adaptation of Stephenie Meyer's vampire novels gives us very few reasons to be excited for the fourth instalment Breaking Dawn. After the disastrous New Moon, director Chris Weitz has been replaced by David Slade who previously made the thriller Hard Candy. His efforts here as a director do not provide this sequel with the drastic leap in quality that some have spoken of. If anything this film is a step-down from the first instalment, which was filmed by Catherine Hardwicke on a modest budget and at least had a rich romantic atmosphere. Eclipse will mean little to those who have not read the books. This is because the story between each of the films has become increasingly banal. Much of the film is devoted to the love triangle but both the dialogue and the performances fail to spark any reason why we should care. Whereas in the first film characters like Bella and Edward were awkward in the uncertainty on each other, and rather ironically human, here the actors are left with schmaltzy and uninteresting conversations about how much they love each and how they are never going to give up. There are also several flashbacks, detailing the origins of the conflict between the werewolves and the vampires, just in case anyone was actually curious. The material is dreary and further compounded by the monotone performances of Stewart and Lautner. Pattinson has a slightly cooler, more charismatic presence here than the others at least. The boring scenes of dialogue and exposition are interspersed with more lively action scenes that are chaotically handled, with many of the vampires being smashed into pieces as though they are made from blocks of ice.

1359,0.0,"Let me just say NOBODY, NOBODY wanted to see this movie more than me. Ever since I was a little kid I had always wanted them to continue the movie trilogies, so of course I was ecstatic to hear that Disney would be continuing it.(ironic)I will never forget what it was like seeing this movie in theaters for the first 20 seconds. I was so excited to see what they would do with the extended universe material. What new places they would make, what new enemies would be fought, but to my disappointment, its a minus well be episode 4 again. The problem with this movie is very simple,it is a remake of episode 4. All the plot points are the same for the most part. No new cool places, no new cool enemies, just the same stuff as last time. For example, the movie starts on a desert planet, like ep 4, there's a droid that has secret plans on it, like ep 4, there's a planet destroying space station, like, episode 4, and there's a battle between the old mentor and bad guy antagonist like ep 4. JJ Abrams lack of creativity is what ruined this movie, as well as his wanting to make the concept of Star Wars so sterile and capid it loses all its morals.The one thing that infuriates me so much about this movie though is what Disney did to it. I don't care that the main protagonist is female, or that there's a black storm trooper or any of that crap. Its the damage they did to the Star Wars narrative and ultimately the community. This movie is made for NORMIES. Now I know what you are thinking \""must be one of those Star Wars elitists again\"" no thats not the case. I don't think you need to know all 50 something hyperspace lanes in the galaxy to be a real Star Wars fan but come on, open your eyes. Its so obvious that this movie is made to be as vapid and simple as possible. This movie is essentially made for millenials and soccer mom families who can go to the theatre and be like \""oh ye get the bad guys\"" and \""oh no the mean dude blew up the stuff\"". For example, what made the destruction of Alderran so horrifying in episode 4 was how the empire seemingly blew it up in such a quick and heartless manner, really showing their strength and cruelty. But in episode 7 when they blow it up, there's no weight to it, heck you don't even know what system they attacked or what the point of it was. It makes the audience feel disconnected from the event. (For those of you who don't know the system that gets destroyed is the Hosnian system which a large portion of the Republic fleet was stationed at). Nope just show some people looking scared and a scary laser going across the sky.I understand Star Wars was meant to be a simple movie that anyone could watch and enjoy, its very universal. But the only reason why it was so universally loved was because of a great story that was also very simple and easy to follow. But there's no innovation here, its not challenging or interesting. You can have a great simple story thats innovating enough and brings in new elements without the audience having to know all the backstory. But there's none of that in episode 7, they don't bring in any nee concepts, because Abrams was to concerned making sure they could sell BB-8 toys instead of making a new unique story.Thats really the problem with this movie, it was made so the average family wouldn't get challenged or offended by anything and just go buy some BB-8 toys for Christmas.","[""the movie is a remake of episode 4. it's essentially made for millenials and soccer mom families. the movie was made so the average family wouldn't get challenged or offended by anything.""]","['let me just say nobody, nobody wanted to see same movie more than me. ever since i was a little kid i had always wanted them to continue the movie trilogies, so of course i was ecstatic to hear that disney would be continuing it.

1366,0.0,"When Emory University Professor Deborah E. Lipstadt published her book \""Denying the Holocaust\"" in 1993, it captured the attention of the notorious British Holocaust Denier David Irving, who eventually brought a lawsuit against her in Britain claiming she damaged his reputation by calling him a \""Holocaust denier, falsifier, and bigot.\""When Irving initially came down to Atlanta and confronted Lipstadt (Rachel Weisz), she refused to speak with him, insisting that any communication with Holocaust deniers would legitimize their arguments. But after Irving filed the lawsuit, she decided to take him on and hired a solicitor, Anthony Julius (Andrew Scott), who was already famous for representing Princess Diana in the divorce proceedings with the Royal Family.Julius explained to Lipstadt that the burden of proof in the British civil system was quite different then in America, with the accused obligated to prove its case, not the plaintiff. Furthermore, Julius pointed out that he wouldn't be arguing the case in court\u2014that he was its organizer. Instead, Richard Rampton was to be the barrister in charge, played magisterially by Tom Wilkinson.The machinations of Lipstadt's defense team are fascinating, including their decision to have the case heard before a judge instead of a jury as well as their insistence that Lipstadt not testify during the trial. What's more, they barred any Holocaust survivors from testifying as they were quite convinced that Irving would probably humiliate them during cross-examination.Director Mick Jackson wisely included scenes outside the courtroom for variety. Perhaps the most effective one involves Lipstadt and Rampton traveling to Auschwitz where they gather evidence in order to refute Irving's claims that extermination in the gas chambers did not occur. Lipstadt also has some compelling scenes where she must deal with a Holocaust survivor who's quite upset that no survivors will be called to testify.Perhaps the weakest aspect of the film is Lipstadt's character. Her back story is negligible and due to the nature of the trial, where she's barred from testifying by her own lawyers, Lipstadt doesn't have as much to do as Rampton, who virtually steals the show. Weisz does her best with a Queens accent but doesn't remind one of the real-life Lipstadt in the least. Nonetheless, Lipstadt's overly emotional nature is ably conveyed by Weisz, and is nicely contrasted with her staid defense team.Timothy Spall as the small-minded Irving proves to be an excellent foil for Wilkinson's Rampton. Spall, who is much shorter than the real-life Irving, still manages to convince as an affable but petty instigator, proving to be as manipulative as any demagogue in recent times.The importance of Denial comes from the expos\u00e9 of Irving's stratagem of deceit. Screenwriter David Hare took the entire trial scenes from verbatim court transcripts, which prove to be gripping to say the least. Irving's arguments are unmasked during cross-examination by Rampton when he claims the gas chambers were used to disinfect corpses and as a bomb shelter for SS men. Rampton points out the absurdity of Irving's assertions by asking why corpses had to be \""disinfected\"" if they were soon after going to be burnt? And the SS men's barracks were 2-3 miles away from the location of the gas chambers and wouldn't have been used for such a purpose.Irving also was exposed for mistranslating passages of documents in order to press his case that Hitler never ordered exterminations of Jews. A quotation from Himmler referring to a \""single transport\"" barred by Hitler suddenly translates to the idea that he ordered none at all.While Denial's denouement is a forgone conclusion (the Judge rules in favor of Lipstadt, chronicling his decision in a voluminous finding), Lipstadt's joyous reaction should be shared by all viewers. Denial does an excellent job of exposing the underbelly of a sordid belief system and a false and manipulative set of polemics.","[""the importance of Denial comes from the exposu00e9 of a sordid belief system.

And when I saw it, I fell in love with it, maybe that should have been a warning that I wouldn't like it much once I've reached maturity.Fast Forward 13 years, and being nostalgic as I am, I decide to watch all 3 Terminator movies in order for old times sake. I couldn't believe the surprise I felt when I found out how horrible this film was. It's earlier installment was a masterpiece, even with the fraction of the budget that James Cameron had for this film. The second incarnation of the Terminator series totally ignores what made the 1st one so good, and instead replaces it as a popcorn, 50's esquire comic book style filming trying to appeal to kids and people with vocabularies limited to 4 lettered words. And it did very well in dumbing down Teriminator into the mess it was in Terminator 2.James Cameron made the biggest amateur mistake with this film in that they made the Terminator into this cheesy compassionate good guy character, which was not only ludicrous, but also very laughable. The potential for irony was strong with a boy growing so attracted to a cold, emotionless machine, as well as the irony of a machine being the ideal protector as opposed to the father John never had. Yet all of this was wasted on this half-assed 'almost human' machine who gives funny one liners and smiles.As if this wasn't enough to destroy this film, We're also treated to an Edward Furlong being well timed into his changing voice.

1369,0.0,"When I was around 5, Titanic came out and my parents had seen it in theaters and hated it. I, however found a big love for the movie, my friends played Titanic on the playground, my friend owned the video and I eventually saw it, well half of it since I wasn't ready for the distress and peril. As I grew, I learned how cheesy, formulaic and just plain god awful this movie was.To start off, I think that the scenery, costumes and sets are magnificent, and some of the characters give life in their roles (The man who played the Captain, Victor Garber and Kathy Bates) the rest, however are just irritating and trying too hard to make their performance stand out. And they do, just not in a good way. Kate Winslet is just a snobby girl who obviously is misunderstood and wishes her mother would listen to her, Leonardo Dicaprio is just a vile, poor boy who seems an awful lot like a rude and bratty version of Tramp(Who is from a rich girl meets poor boy story that works, \""Lady and the Tramp.\"") Billy Zane plays Rose's Fianc\u00e9, Cal and uses an accent that mocks the British as do most of the other supporting actors. Plus, Cal is convinced that the ship is unsinkable, as is everyone, except Rose who is \""educated\"" (apparently knowing who Freud is makes her a smart scholar.) But she's a girl! Why listen to her?! This Ship is Unsinakble! It is she who notices that they're aren't enough lifeboats, but is reassured once again by another man that the ship can't and won't sink. Enoguh on that, let us talk about the main plot.Titanic was a ship that was to sail from Ireland to New York, we all know that. But, it seems that the Director, James Cameron (Who is usually a good director and who redeemed himself with Ghosts of the Abyss.) does not know anything but that small fact, and that many Irish people were in third class. The many wonderful stories about the ship, not that the death of many people is a good thing, but that the tales survivors have passed down about their voyage on the Titanic. If James contacted the few still alive or read a book, he would maybe make this film get two stars for researching the stories of the ships passengers. Anyway, Rose is on the ship with her mother and fianc\u00e9, but she is not happy. Jack is a poor boy who wins tickets to the Titanic in a game of poker and lives his life to its fullest. They meat while suicidal Rose is about to jump and Jack won't let her. If this were the real world, any chance that these two would meet, or that she would even come near the third class deck would be very slim. So long story short, he saves her from falling. While doing so, the police hear screams coming from her and when they arrive, it appears that he is raping her. They arrest Jack, but Rose says that he saved her and he goes scotch free. Then, their bond begins.Already, within the first forty five minutes am I bored, waiting for the ship to sink and not center around these two bratty kids who never even existed, but the story makes them as big as the ship itself. So these two become friends and Jack teaches Rose how to live a little, which means he gets her to hock spit and dance at a drunken third class party and escape the upper prestigious class. Soon Rose begins to realize, Do I even love Cal? Is Jack the one for me? He understands her and she understands him, unfortunately her mother disapproves of their romance because he's poor and she's engaged. Rose then tries to end her romance with Jack, but like every other romance movie she goes with the man she just met and apparently the choice was right. They stand on the edge of the ship and \""fly,\"" he draws her nude only wearing her necklace Cal gave to her as an engagement present. If you have been living in a cave or hopefully haven't heard of Titanic, these scenes are none as its most memorable, as is their sex scene in the back of a car. Luckily, the iceberg hits and all hell breaks loose. After Cal insisting it won't sink it does! And nobody listen to Rose! Cal wants her, but she says, \""I'd rather be a whore then your wife.\"" Soon enough, Jack and Rose are together in the water all cold and near death, but they can still churn out cinematic waste. While watching it, I found their love being broken not as important as the many people dying right next to them. And before you know it, Jack dies. It would be pretty obvious because when a disaster occurs, one of the lovers is bound to die. Eventually, selfish Rose is rescued and calls herself Rose Dawson, which makes me laugh. She knows him for two days and then considers their little unimportant romance like marriage, Please. The end is when the diamond the explorers are searching for isn't found, Rose has it, she dumps it over the edge and then meets Jack in heaven. There, I saved you three hours of your life.Adding on to the boring love story, the music sounds like Enya half the time and the rest like music you hear in a Nordstrom's store at the mall(the theme is sung by sea wench Celene Dion another disaster for the film).

is jack the one for me? he understands her and she understand him, unfortunately her mother disapproves of their romance because he\'s poor and she\'s engaged. rose then tries to end her romance with jack, but like every other romance movie she goes with the man she just met and apparently the choice was right. they stand on the edge of the ship and \\ "" fly, \\ "" he draws her nude only wearing her necklace cal gave to her as an engagement present. if you have been living in a cave or hopefully haven\'t heard of titanic, these scenes are none as its most memorable, as is their sex scene in the back of a car. luckily, the iceberg hits and all hell breaks loose. after cal insisting it won\'t sink it does! and nobody listen to rose! cal wants her, but she says, \\ "" i\'d rather be a whore then your wife. \\ "" soon enough, jack and rose are together in the water all cold and near death, but they can still churn out cinematic waste. while watching it, i found their love being broken not as important as the many people dying right next to them. and before you know it, jack dies. it would be pretty obvious because when a disaster occurs, one of the lovers is bound to die. eventually, selfish rose is rescued and calls herself rose dawson, which makes me laugh. she knows him for two days and then considers their little unimportant romance like marriage, please. the end is when the diamond the explorers are searching for isn\'t found, rose has it, she dumps it over the edge and then meets jack in heaven. there, i saved you three hours of your life. adding on to the boring love story, the music sounds like enya half the time and the rest like music you hear in a nordstrom\'s store at the mall ( the theme is sung by sea wench celene dion another disaster for the film ). the script sounds like a dreary english paper using vocabulary words i learned in seventh grade. at least it is when the two lovebirds aren\'t screaming \\ "" jack! jack! \\ "" or \\ "" rose!! \\ "" the star goes to scenery, and it stays that way.']"

The characters are so cardboard, and granted we aren't expecting Oscar-winning material here, but what came through was more of an insult to the genre of ninja movies.

But not before deciding to exact revenge for his beloved lady ninja, and thus a showdown is set up.

1424,0.0,"For those expecting the creator of \""I Am Not Your Negro,\"" the new racially incendiary documentary based on an unfinished manuscript by James Baldwin, to be culled from the ranks of a new crop of young black militants, guess again. The documentary is by the 63 year old, Haitian-born, Raoul Peck, who grew up in the Democratic Republic of Congo and now spends most of his time as head of a film school in France and living in the US. He's also an unrepentant Marxist whose next film is scheduled for release as the \""Young Marx.\""Peck's comments at a recent Q&amp;A made it clear that he's been a fan of James Baldwin from time immemorial. He was able to get the rights to Baldwin's entire oeuvre including the unfinished manuscript \""Remember This House,\"" which explores the history of race relations through the prism of the three fallen African-American icons, victims of assassins during the 1960s: Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X and Medgar Evers.Peck has assembled an extraordinary treasure trove of archival footage which he has seamlessly edited, and conscripted the noted actor, Samuel L. Jackson, to read Baldwin's words as the voice-over narration. Visually, Peck rivals Ken Burns as one of the master documentarians of today. There are many clips of Baldwin speaking (on the Dick Cavett show for example) as well as newsreel footage from the 50s and 60s, highlighting the many instances of racist behavior on the part of white American society, particularly during the civil rights era. Baldwin's wrath and Peck's too not only indict the obvious southern racism of the times but those of northern whites too\u2014Robert Kennedy is particularly excoriated for paying lip service to the aims of the civil rights movement. Peck also intersperses images of more contemporary victims of police brutality (such as the Rodney King beatings and Trayvon Martin).Peck has a particular fondness for American films from the 50s, particularly musicals, which he views as saccharine and out of touch with the reality of violence against African-Americans throughout American history. In one instance, the \""lily white\"" image of Doris Day is contrasted with the next set of images\u2014a group of turn of the century blacks, lynched by white (presumably southern) racists.Much of the documentary features Baldwin's incessant diatribes against the \""white man.\"" Peck makes it clear that Baldwin's focus is more on \""class\"" than \""race.\"" One might surmise that Peck is arguing that the entire social structure must be changed before equality is achieved between the races. But that seems to be a baseless canard as Malcolm X is shown (at least before his trip to Mecca) as a clear opponent of integration and brands Martin Luther King Jr., his so-called \""comrade- in-arms\"" in the civil right struggle, as nothing more than an \""Uncle Tom.\"" Underneath all the militant babble about the need for \""respect\"" and \""dignity\"", it's economic equality that is truly being demanded here.The problem with Peck's documentary is that it's all wrapped up in the figure of the chain-smoking provocateur, Baldwin. Unlike Peck, I am no fan of Baldwin, whose negative, \""the glass is half empty\"" outlook on race relations, is more than grating. The failure of Peck's documentary revolves around his lack of balance\u2014there is no attempt at self-criticism of the African-American community\u2014one comes away from I Am Not Your Negro with an image of African-Americans as an exclusively noble group demonized by whites. One of course cannot ignore the extremely deleterious effect racism and discrimination had on African-Americans throughout our history but how can anyone move forward if one embraces a culture of victimology?Instead of Baldwin, perhaps Nelson Mandela should have been Peck's subject here. Unlike Baldwin, who spent years of exile in France, Mandela was imprisoned for years by a racist South African regime. Unlike the negative Baldwin, who held little hope for racial reconciliation, Mandela went out and immediately established truth and reconciliation committees and forgave the white community for the years of Apartheid in South Africa, working for racial reconciliation until the end of his days.Peck is no doubt an extremely talented filmmaker whose choice of Baldwin as his documentary subject is unfortunate. One wonders if Baldwin was truly committed to economic equality or simply enjoyed getting a rise out of his audience--flipping the proverbial \""middle finger\"" at the very people who appeared to welcome and revel in his demeaning insults.","['""I Am Not Your Negro"" is a new racially incendiary documentary based on an unfinished manuscript by James Baldwin. john sutter: the failure of Peck\'s documentary revolves around his lack of balance.']","['for those but the creator of \\ "" i am not your negro, \\ "" the new racially incendiary documentary based on an unfinished manuscript by james baldwin, to be culled from the ranks of a new crop of young black militants, guess again. the documentary exist by the 63 year old, haitian - born, raoul peck, who grew up in the democratic republic of congo and now spends most of his time as head of a film school in france and living in the us. he\'s also an unrepentant marxist whose newest film is scheduled for release as the \\ at a recent q & amp ; a made it clear that he\'s been a fan of james baldwin from time immemorial. he was able to get the rights to baldwin\'s entire oeuvre including the unfinished manuscript \\ "" remember this house, \\ "" which explores the history of race relations through the prism of the three fallen african - canadian icons, victims of assassins during the 1960s : martin luther king jr., malcolm x and medgar evers. peck has assembled an extraordinary treasure trove of archival footage which he has seamlessly assembled, and conscripted the noted actor, samuel l. jackson, to read baldwin\'n words as the voice - over narration. visually, peck rivals ken burns as one of the master documentarians of today. there are many clips of baldwin speaking ( on the dick cavett show for example ) as well as newsreel footage into the 50s and 1960s, highlighting the many instances of racist behavior on the part of white american society, particularly during the civil rights era. baldwin\'s wrath in peck\'s too not only indict the obvious southern racism of the times but those of northern whites too \\ u2014robert kennedy is specially excoriated for paying lip service to the aims of the civil rights movement. peck also intersperses images of more contemporary victims of police brutality ( such in the rodney king beatings and trayvon martin ). peck has a particular fondness for american films from the 50s, particularly musicals, which he views as saccharine and out of touch with the reality of violence against african - american language throughout american history. in one instance, the \\ "" lily white \\ "" image of doris day is contrasted with the next set of images \\ u2014a group of turn of the century blacks, lynched by white ( presumably southern ) racists. much of the material features baldwin \' s incessant diatribes against the \\ "" white man. \\ "" peck makes it clear that baldwin\'s focus is more on \\ "" class \\ "" than \\ "" race. \\ "" one might surmise that peck is arguing that the entire social structure must be changed before equality is achieved between the races. but that seems to be a baseless canard as malcolm x is shown ( at least before his trip to mecca ) as a clear opponent of integration and brand martin martin luther king jr., his so - called \\ "" comrade - in - arms \\ "" in the civil right struggle, as nothing more than an \\ "" uncle tom. \\ "" underneath all the militant babble about the need for \\ "" respect \\ "" and \\ "" dignity \\ "", it\'s economic equality that is truly being demanded here. the problem with peck\'s documentary is that it\'s all wrapped up in the figure of the chain - smoking provocateur, baldwin. unlike peck, i am no fan of baldwin, whose negative, \\ "" the glass is half empty \\ "" outlook on race relations, is more than grating. the failure of peck\'s documentary revolves around his lack of balance \\ u2014there is no attempt at self - criticism of the african - american community \\ u2014one comes away from i am not your negro with an image of african - americans as an exclusively stately group demonized by whites. one of course cannot ignore the extremely deleterious effect racism and discrimination had on african - americans throughout our history but how can anyone move forward if one embraces a culture of victimology?

1489,0.0,"How interesting. In a fairly fixed pattern, user reviews that complement THE LAST BOY gets a high \""helpful\"" score and every critical review gets a very low score. Oh, well. Apparently THE LAST BOY has an established following of pudding-brained New Age fan-folk. Low \""helpful\"" score here I come.Most of the basic elements of THE LAST BOY are either good or at least adequate to purpose. The actors fit their roles, the acting was adequate given the fact that there weren't many beats that required advanced acting chops, the music was pretty good with occasional echoes of Bernard Herrmann.The plot of THE LAST BOY is mostly the same as A QUIET PLACE and BIRD BOX and others of a similar ilk; something disastrous has \""happened\"" in the world and whatever it was has left \""monsters\"" hanging about and picking off the remaining human survivors. This is not original by any means, of course, but I don't have a problem with that. When was the last time you saw a truly original story? As long as it's a WELL DONE disaster-with-left-over-monster-residue-sauce movie I'm happy with it.Unfortunately, it's the story that makes, or breaks, a movie in my opinion. Something that actually qualifies as a story is definitely NOT a \""s*** happened in my head and I puked it up on the script\"" sort of affair. A good story needs to have cohesion, coherency and, at a minimum, make at least a little sense. Random twaddle scribbled on a page does not a story make.MOST of the story line of THE LAST BOY hangs together fairly well. Young boy in a world filled with monsters sets out on a quest given to him by his recently deceased mother. With his trusty magic sword (or, in this case, a mysterious electronic doodad that fills the function of a weapon against the monsters) at his side, off he goes on his adventure. The quest does seem a little odd even from the get-go: to make it to the place where \""wishes are granted\"". I just put that little anomaly down as something a dying mother tells her preteen boy to motivate him to get where he needs to go; I'm guessing some sort of actual sanctuary. How wrong I was.Along the way to his great objective, our hero boy meets noble and nefarious people alike, and even picks up a few hangers on to accompany him on his journey.But as the story rolls along it starts exhibiting what can only be called storytelling \""sins\"", signs of inept storytelling. These are tells for nonexistent storytelling skills. Classic examples would be engaging in \""it was all a dream\"" or the infamous Deus ex Machina (ESPECIALLY at the END of a story).SOME storytelling laziness can be forgiven, such as a complete lack of any legitimate explanation for ANYTHING upon which the story is based. In THE LAST BOY we never really find out what the disaster was or where these monsters came from or what the monsters actually are. The most we get is a vague allusion to some science event (whatever that is) and no explanation at all about the monsters. Certainly A QUIET PLACE and BIRD BOX and other similar movies did the same thing; sort of a \""here's your monsters - off you go\"" approach. But if you're going to do this sort of thing, you can't then have plot points that suggest that the origin and character of the monsters are very well understood.Very incongruously, our hero is equipped with a military grade, advanced electronic device that's capable of effortlessly warding off the monsters and is obviously purpose-made for the task. We are told that whatever happened that caused the original disaster and produce the monsters, happened fast and wiped out lots of people nearly immediately. Yet SOMEBODY had the time to gather enough information, and had the months it would take, to be able to build these electronic anti-monster talismans. Our hero's mother mysteriously worked for the government in some capacity, had access to these anti-monster devices, and somehow knew of a place that one could go to get \""wishes granted\"". Where did all this information come from, not to mention all the time and infrastructure?And the ending was certainly a deus ex machina variation if I ever saw one and which has no place in a movie that supposed to be something having to do with science fiction. At the end of the movie, literal dead people show up reincarnated in people-sized bubbles standing in the middle of a nonstop wave of wind-monsters, the same wind-monsters that have been killing people all throughout the picture. Where did they come from and how did they get reincarnated? How did they get here? What are the wind-monsters doing and why have they suddenly stop attacking? What are those bubbles the supposedly-already-dead-people are standing in? Why do the bubble people just stand there way out in the middle of the storm of wind-monsters instead of walking towards their loved ones (because if their loved ones move toward them its instant death for them from the wind-monsters)?One of the already-dead people, the wife of one of the members of our hero's crew, witnesses her loved one getting killed and turned to dust by the wind-monsters when he attempts to walk out to her and, in her grief, apparently is herself KILLED AGAIN and TURNED TO DUST AGAIN. What the hell is going on there?Is this open field at the end of the movie that is covered in a nonstop wave of wind-monsters the make-a-wish place? How did the hero's mother know about it at the beginning of the picture when she was dying in a camper so far away?TWO people show up for our hero in bubbles and standing out there in the deathly wind: his erstwhile dead mother and a sweet little girl who got killed along the way during the quest, both coaxing the hero to themselves with outstretched arms. When our hero fords his way out to them through the death wind, he's told he has to choose one of them. Why is that? What happens to the one he chooses and what happens to the one he DOESN'T choose? Who made up these rules? What do these rules MEAN?Basically, the ending makes no sense at all. It isn't that it's subtle or thought-provoking or \""deep\"". It's just made up, stream-of-consciousness BS because the storyteller couldn't think of a decent ending after having written himself into a corner. Making such a story end \""mysteriously\"" with \""thought-provoking ambiguity\"" is just how a bad writer tries to conceal the fact that he doesn't have any skill at telling a story and couldn't think of an end for this one.This is apparently playing well with the hippie-dippy New Age crowd around here.

1490,0.0,"Being a huge fan of the Twilight series from the beginning, I am more then perturbed by the movie attempt. It was, for lack of a better word incomprehensible. So many little minute details were left out that were so much a part of the story line and that is a HUGE disappointment to watch\u0085. I can understand that it is not always easy to incorporate every detail from a book to a movie but the little deviations stole from the story.I have always pictured Bella as a shy, sweet girl with a naive air to her and this was not portrayed in the movie. I did not find the Bella in the movie to have even a remote resemblance in personality to the Bella (that I know and love) in the book. I feel the movie was based too loosely on the book and anyone who did not first read the story would not understand some of the feeble attempts that were portrayed (the lullaby for example) in the movie. If you had not read, the book you would not understand that Edward actually wrote that Lullaby for Bella it would just appear that he was playing a song on the piano for her.

So I've been in an environment where there's been some HUGE fans who were willing to pay for VIP tickets, and around people that thought it was going to be a terrible movie. And, I was shocked at how my friends reacted.Although I'm a little biased since I've liked Justin since before he even became famous, this movie surprised me. I've always had to deal with people being extremely harsh on the 16 year old popstar, and saying things that nobody should be saying to anyone. So, I'm so glad this movie came out.During the movie, it starts off with someone opening e-mails and seeing youtube videos, and then Justin's version of \""With You\"" with only 50,000 views at the time pops up. It flashes forward to him being backstage about to perform at MSG, and flashes back and forth to the clip.This movie has plenty of interaction with fans. They're interviewed, and talk about why they love Justin, and they're shown being ecstatic over being given tickets by Justin and his crew to have amazing seats to the concert. But, it wasn't just about the fans.You see the difficulties Justin goes through. There's a point in the movie where Justin gets really sick, and is distraught over having to cancel a show. You see him at the doctor getting his vocal chords inspected (and gagging trying to do so), and you see him hug his mom and grandpa in his tour bus and laying in a dark room trying to find relief from being sick. You see clips of him trying to do homework and eat at the same time, and you see him try to be a normal kid. He was running around with his friends with everyone staring, and at one point his vocal coach said how \""sometimes Justin talks about wanting to be normal, and we say 'you gave up being normal. This is your new normal.'\"" You get to meet Justin's family and hear about his mom and dad, and his grandparents and friends, and much, much more.In the end, you see the story of how a normal kid with a dream ended up living it in a way nobody thought was possible. You see how even though he's the biggest popstar in the world, how he's totally a normal teenaged boy who likes to do teenaged things. It's extremely inspiring because of the fact that a 16 year old is doing what no other 16 year old has done before. And, it shows that if you follow your dreams and don't give up, that anything can happen. Justin got told \""no\"" by so many record companies and told that he needed to have a platform like Nickelodeon or Disney to get him anywhere. But he wouldn't give up.My friends, who walked into the movie thinking it was going to be terrible, walked out extremely surprised at how much they liked it. I've had many other friends who admitted they were almost ashamed at how much they liked it. I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. If you love him, you'll love him more, and if you hate him, you at least would be able to understand him a little better before you judge him. Justin is a sweet, caring, hilarious 16 year old that's just living his dream and trying to be normal at the same time.The only thing I could think of negative is that some of the parts in the trailers isn't in the movie, or a lot of the parts you see in the trailers are in the credits in just clips. So some parts give off the impression that there's more that you're going to see of that particular part, but in the end, I think everyone just wants a little bit more of Justin.

1553,0.0,"Last night I watched this film. Just before the credits rolled, one of my cats got up, gave a disdainful sniff, walked into the bathroom and into his box, and delivered his own large and malodorous comment.I have to go with my cat on this one. My immediate reaction to this film when it ended was, very simply, \""Great looking, but the dumbest story I have seen in a long, long time.\"" I have to admit to a few criteria here. I am not an animation fan. For me, animation pretty much begins and ends with Warner Brothers and Chuck Jones, who taught us all that pretty pictures and trembling leaves and water droplets always get trumped by a great script. Jones's best work, combining a linear and somewhat abstract style with high and low comedy, is the best. Disney--let's face it--is gooey. And many other recent animation hits have been 15 minute shorts exploded into features, like \""The Triplets of Bellville,\"" which would have been far better if it had stopped after the first 15 minutes. (Okay, okay, I did like \""Toy Story\"". And \""Fantasia.\"") \""Princess Mononoke\"" gets points for two things. First, it looks good and often looks wonderful. Second, it does sustain itself for close to two hours. And credit is due for trying to be serious, while still catering to the core kid demographic. However, Miyazaki's script is, to put it charitably, a mess. Its civilization vs. nature theme is very, very tired, and most of the time it just does not make any sense. A single example: Forest Spirit's head is removed. FS turns into a Japanese version of the blob and destroying the forest. FS gets head back--dies and crushes Irontown--and the forest grows again. Someone please convince me that this can make any sense whatsoever. If you are going to the trouble of creating a film for adults with capital-S Significance, you ought at least to make your case persuasively.

( okay, okay, i did like \\ "" toy story \\ "". and \\ "" fantasia. \\ "" ) \\ "" princess mononoke \\ "" gets points for two things. first, it looks good and often looks wonderful. second, it does sustain itself for close to two hours. and credit is due for trying to be serious, while still catering to the core kid demographic. however, miyazaki\'s script is, to put information technology charitably, a great deal. its civilization vs. nature theme is very, very tired, and most of the time it certainly does not make any sense. a single example : forest spirit\'s head is removed. this combines into a japanese version of the blob and destroying the forest. fs gets head back - - dies and crushes irontown - - and the forest grows again. someone please convince me that this can make any sense whatsoever. if you are going to the trouble of creating a film for adults with capital - s significance, us ought at least to make your case persuasively. i can call it ecological consciousness ; you can call it shinto animism ; i address it pretentious, ill - digested crap. this is been blow as one of the great films of our time. sorry, this director will generally agree with his cat\'s tribute. seek it out if you are an animation junkie and enthralled with the techniques. i certainly cannot recommend it as a film.']"

1576,0.0,"I'm not gonna sugarcoat it: Fairy Tail is easily the worst example of its genre, Shonen, that there is... and it's BAD! From it's terrible execution of fights to overuse of fan service, from the nonsensical character motivation to the plot induced stupidity and shark-jumping, from its clich\u00e9d and obnoxious characters and its overuse of friendship speeches that replace meaningful dialogue, Fairy Tail as a whole is just garbage. Only the greatest numb-skulls love this train wreck and even then most don't even watch it for anything else but the love affairs (shipping) that really aren't the focus of the series in the first or last place.This movie follows right into the shoes of its source material. To start off, this movie was promised to take place AFTER the events of the manga, servicing as a climax to the series in the same manners as \""The Last: Naruto the Movie\"" was to the Naruto manga. This is quickly dashed to pieces as it apparently takes place after the events of the Tartaros arc. So already we can tell that we're being lied to by the author himself, Hiro Mashima... not that being deceived by him isn't already common occurrence after the many times we were suckered into his horrible changes.The plot itself is also basically a rehash of the last movie: An evil ruler of a newly introduced kingdom steals an ancient artifact of great power that he wants to use to take over the world; introducing King Animus as the Prince Cream and Sonya as the \u00c9clair of this movie. There is, like in the manga, no originality in the story or characters. It's really a by-the-numbers Fairy Tail production with nothing you haven't seen before. The only difference: the budget is MUCH larger and the animation is nicer... what a waste of time and money.The action is as simplistic and typically Fairy Tail as well, giving us the exact same formula of \""good guy gets really beaten up but then believes in his friends and 1-shot the much more powerful enemy\"" that the series is infamous about. While we do get to see the highly hyped up Natsu as a semi-dragon it doesn't excuse the sloppy and boring action that FT has to offer on a constant basis.The biggest difference Fairy Tail has with other series of its genre is the overuse of fan service. Whereas most Shonen have fan service but don't let it overstay its welcome, Fairy Tail actively tries to make itself appear like a soft-core hentai or unabashed ecchi. From Lucy using her weak sex appeal to get her wishes (contradictory to what her claims that she doesn't like doing this) to Erza being unfazed of being naked in front of anyone (save for Jellal) to the pathetic pandering of bathroom/sauna scenes, Fairy Tail has made a name for itself as the most depraved Shonen there is. Dragon Cry's promotional material and trailers all seemed to bash this into our heads by showing it's main character, Lucy Heartfilia, in seductive belly-dancer clothing, clothing she wears throughout a large portion of the movie... all to keep the viewer invested in seeing her for exactly what she is: a tool. I'm not going to act like fan service isn't allowed in Shonen but it has to make sense and be but a small distraction from serious or during comedic moments... not take up over 30% of the material. Fairy Tail's biggest fans only come to see half or fully naked 2D animated characters being put in situations of embarrassment, only to salivate over it like depraved horny mongrels.Fairy Tail's strongest point, which the manga lacks obviously, is the anime's musical score. Music has always been a thing Fairy Tail does surprisingly right, giving us upbeat and sinister orchestral to soft and soothing scores. So as much as the movie is dull and boring, if you close your eyes and just listen then you might catch some good music every now and then when the characters aren't speaking.

from it\'s terrible execution of fights to overuse of fan service, from the nonsensical character motivation to the plot induced stupidity and shark - jumping, from its clich \\ u00e9d and obnoxious characters and its overuse of friendship actor\'s line that replace meaningful dialogue, fairy tail as a whole is just garbage. only the greatest numb - skulls love this train wreck and even then most don\'t even watch it for anything else but the love affairs ( shipping ) that really aren\'t the focus of the series in the first or last place. this movie follows right into the shoes of its source material. to start off, this movie was promised to take place like all events of the manga, servicing as a climax to the series in the same manners as \\ "" the last : naruto the third \\ "" was to the naruto manga. this is the events of the tartaros arc. so already we can tell that we\'re being lied to by the author myself, hiro mashima... not that anything deceived by him didn\'t already common occurrence after the many times we were suckered into his horrible changes. the plot itself is also basically a rehash of the last movie : an evil ruler of a newly introduced kingdom steals an ancient artifact of great power that he wants to use to take over the world ; introducing king animus as the prince cream and sonya as the \\ u00c9clair of this movie. there is, like in the manga, no originality in the story or characters. it\'s really a by - the - numbers fairy tail production containing nothing you haven\'t seen before. the only difference : the budget is much larger and the setting is nicer... what a waste of time and money. the action is as simplistic and typically fairy tail as well, giving us the exact same formula of \\ "" good guy gets really beaten up but then believes in strong friends and 1 - shot the much more powerful enemy \\ "" that the serial is infamous about. while we do get to see the highly hyped up natsu as a semi - dragon it doesn\'t excuse the sloppy and complicated action that ft has to offer on a constant basis. the biggest difference fairy tail has with other series of its genre is the overuse of fan service. whereas most shonen have fan service but don\'t let it overstay its welcome, fairy tail actively tries to make itself appear like a soft - core hentai operating theater unabashed ecchi. from lucy using her weak sex appeal to get her wishes ( contradictory to what her claims that she doesn\'t like doing this ) to erza being unfazed of being naked in front of anyone ( save for jellal ) to the pathetic pandering of bathroom / sauna scenes, fairy tail has made a name for itself as the most depraved shonen there is. dragon cry\'s promotional material and trailers all seemed to bash this into our heads by showing it\'s main character, lucy heartfilia, in seductive belly - dancer clothing, clothing she wears throughout a large portion of the movie... all to keep the viewer invested in seeing her for exactly what she is : a tool. i\'m not going to act like fan service isn\'t allowed in shonen but it has to make sense and be but a small distraction from serious or during comedic moments... not take up over 30 % of the material. fairy tail\'s biggest fans only come to see half or fully naked 2d animated characters being put in situations of embarrassment, only to salivate over it like depraved horny mongrels. fairy tail\'s potent point, which the manga lacks obviously, is the anime\'s musical score. music has always been a thing fairy tail does surprisingly right, giving us upbeat and sinister orchestral to soft and soothing scores. so as much as the movie is dull and boring, if you close your eyes and just listen then you might catch some good music every now and then when the characters aren\'t speechmaking. if that doesn\'t do it for you, refrain from wasting money on this movie and just buy / download the ost of it and enjoy what little good it has to offer. in conclusion, not that it comes to anyone\'s surprise, this movie is purely a waste of time, effort and money. hiro mashima was stated to have written the script and story of this movie and it blatantly shows. it has everything good and bad, especially bad, that the worst of shonen has to offer. i would tell its fans to not waste their time watching it but i know that would be as much a waste of effort as everything else. so to them i say : this is exactly what you\'re used to, only with nicer animation and a longer running time... enjoy your garbage!

1581,0.0,"Just finished watching this movie, I actually didn't want to watch this but curiosity got the better of me(all that bad reviews and such). In hindsight i should not have believed people when they said it was so bad it's good, for me it was torture.1 major complaint from me is that IT WAS BORING. Scenes of the same nature/conversation keeps repeating over and over again. These scenes also are dragged on and on AND ON. It is like this movie was on 1/4 the speed. You just want to scream at them to JUST MOVE ON! \""I GET IT, YOU THINK SHE SHOULDN'T BE WITH YOU BLAH BLAH BLAH, PLEASE MOVE FORWARD\"". It is unbelievable how little substance is in this movie considering the runtime is approx. 2 hours.Also, this was a horrible romantic movie, you'd think a romantic movie would be about how they interact, getting to know each other's interests, quirks and falling in love. With these 2, I feel like they just knew each other for 3 days and they SOMEHOW became obsessed with each other. This due to the fact that they gloss over their interactions in just rotating shots around them, staring at each other with dead eyes. I WANT to know these interactions, I WANT to get a chance to actually see them together, I WANT to see them as characters with distinct personalities(regardless if likable or not) so that I CAN AT LEAST TRY TO SEE WHY THEY ARE OBSESSED WITH EACH OTHER. I feel like if they explored this part it could be salvaged(like 0.1% chance), at least it would be I.N.T.E.R.S.T.I.N.G.(subjective) I immensely dislike how Bella treated the father, I hate how cruel and mean spirited she was. She DEFINITELY could have gone another route to let her go. Especially since she doesn't have to say that last line(\""if I don't get out now, I'll just be stuck here like mom.\"") where he was definitely going to let her go. What an insensitive little tw*t. I can see she feels mean about doing that to her dad and i was looking forward to seeing how Bella apologises for her actions and they forgive each other and GUESS WHAT? IT NEVER HAPPENS. Put this in perspective, there were tons upon tons of bullshit scenes that do not add value to the narrative, sub plots that just flatline because there is no time? All to be filled in for the utterly necessary awkward silent moments the director seems to love. It's almost like a running gag that just make everyone annoyed and awkward.From the movie i feel like the director is just summarising what ever is in the book into a minute. She must have thought \""well the books have it i guess i'll have to put it somewhere to get it over and done with\"". It feels rushed and pointless because it does not delve into anything, it is just saying the lines from the book. So, if the scene would be pointless WHY PUT IT THERE. It is an adaptation, we understand, there are bound to be differences between the novel and movie. You have to trim the fat leave the essence, boil it until it is thick and delicious, not diluted and tasting of nothing.There are movies like harry potter that make you want to run straight home after the movie and read the original books it was adapted from and then you have twilight that makes you want to burn the books.People whom i can see enjoying this films are actually only the book lovers. They can add in the contexts that aren't in the movie from their contextual knowledge, these probably fill the gaping holes of the films.At least I can say I survived the twilight movies, will I ever watch another from this trilogy(or like 5-logy?idk) NEVER.**Elaborating on my summary, I started off sprouting out everything i feel is stupid, unnecessary or illogical and became angry, i rid on this wave for like 3/4 of the show just getting angrier and angrier. Until I was screaming and growling into my hand, i realised how crazy i was becoming and i just told myself to relax and just watch without talking. Well it did not last long, i was soon finding myself tiredly questioning the sanity of the movie. I could have easily stopped myself from watching this, but i found myself unable to stop as i needed to prove that i can survive a stupid movie to it's completion. If cinemasins could watch it five times why can't i? After the movie ended, i felt my brain in a state of mush that i don't really want to get out of so i started writing this review, now that this is finished i feel like a SPIDER MONKEY as i just dumped most of the bullshit that i am capable of putting in words into this review :) Screw this movie.","['cnn\'s jarrett bellini says twilight is a horrible romantic movie. he says it glosses over their interactions in just rotating shots around them.

This is probably one of the worst movies (animated or not) that I've seen in my entire life. \""Foodfight!\"" summarizes everything what is wrong with all the modern animated CGI films that try to imitate the Pixar formula, being atrocious at every single level. I just can't think anything remotely positive about this turd: The animation is awful and poorly made (I honestly think that shows like \""ReBoot\"" or \""Beast Wars\"" looked better than this\u0085And those were done almost twenty years ago) the characters are obnoxious, unlikeable and (to add insult to injury) some of them are offensive stereotypes. The plot didn't made any single bit of sense, the jokes were dumb and inappropriate (I know that is a common practice for most of the recent animated films to include some hints of adult humor for the older viewers, but \""Foodfight!\"" is just creepy.

But my larger issue is from the animal welfare point of view. Of course Hachi shows great loyalty to his owner - but where is the family's loyalty to him? They abandon him to the streets for 10 years, to survive on scraps and hot dogs, and sleep under rail cars. And then they hug him, and cry, and talk about his amazing loyalty?

1638,0.0,"I was looking forward to this, but now that I've finally seen it I'm somewhat disappointed, this is clearly a dead end for Michael Moore's film-making career and a low point in his crusade for truth and freedom (of speech). First of all, it looks like a made for TV documentary, it has not the usual wit and cleverness of a Michael Moore documentary, the editing is pretty lame too, it is a mediocre piece both in content and execution. Bowling for Columbine remains Moore's best, Farenheit coming in a close second, but Sicko has to be one of his worst efforts to date. Just picking apart the life stories of a random bunch of people does nothing to lend credibility to his arguments, it simply makes it personal but not objective, it's not even all that personal anymore since he doesn't seem to be interested in the human factor but is looking for bizarre circumstances that he can use for HIS narrative (a good documentarian adopts his style to the stories of the people its about, it reconstructs their narrative), like he went to the interviews with a checklist this time. He's still out for laughs and tears, business as usual one might say, but this time it feels even more contrived than usual, more like a freak show than honest sympathy for the health care \""victims\"", sadly he's not after a balanced representation of the health care system itself either, so what's his point, what's his motive? Could it be that although he does hardly appear on screen anymore it's now Moore than ever (pun intended) about self propagating his own persona? Crap happens everywhere, it's a law of nature, no system is perfect, and if you dig long enough, and obviously Moore by now has a large research team at his disposal, you'll find all the grotesque stories your heart and your audience desires, but they in no way will lend credibility to your arguments, and they do not justify calling Sicko a documentary, it's rather a biopic with Moore acting as his own ghostwriter. So, to sum it up, wait until it's on TV (or download it from the net if you must), just don't be part of the hype and buy a ticket for this, buy aspirin instead :) It doesn't even work as a movie this time around either, it's not a comedy, it's not a satire, it's not even good entertainment, with Moore's other documentaries you could at least turn of your brain, ignore the \""facts\"" based side of his cinematic diatribes and just enjoy them as great pieces of fiction and a jukebox approach to modern history and politics. Sicko doesn't go together with popcorn all that well, it's an overlong session of finger pointing with no direction and nowhere to go, no wonder they end up near Guantanamo Bay towards the end of the movie, and when Moore unpacks his bullhorn and tries to communicate with a far off security tower you know you have reached the bottom of ludicrous, it's so pathetic it almost creates an image of Moore as a modern day anti Don Quijote or a fool's fool.","['""sicko"" is a mediocre piece both in content and execution. it\'s a biopic with Moore acting as his own ghostwriter. if you want to see it, buy aspirin instead.']","['i was looking forward to this, but now this i\'ve finally seen it i\'m somewhat disappointed, this is clearly a dead end for michael moore\'s film - making career and a low point in his crusade for truth and freedom ( of speech ). first of all, it looks like a made for tv documentary, it has not the the editing is pretty square too, it is a mediocre piece both in content and execution. bowling for columbine stay moore\'s best, farenheit coming in a next second, but sicko has to be one of his worst efforts until date. just picking apart the life stories of a random bunch of people does nothing to lend credibility to his arguments, it simply makes it personal but not objective, it\'l not even all that personal anymore since he doesn\'t seem to be interested in the human factor but is looking for bizarre circumstances that he can use for his narrative ( a good documentarian adopts his style to the level of the people its about, it reconstructs their narrative ), like he went to the interviews with the checklist this time. he\'s still out for laughs and tears, business as usual one might say, but this time it feels even more contrived than that, more like a freak show than honest sympathy for the wellness care \\ "" victims \\ "", sadly he\'s not after a balanced representation of the health care system itself either, so what\'s his point, what\'s his motive? could it prove that although he does hardly appear on screen then it\'s now moore than ever ( pun intended ) about self propagating his own persona? crap happens everywhere, it\'s a law of nature, no system is perfect, and if you dig long enough, and obviously moore by now has very large research team at his disposal, you\'ll find all the grotesque stories your heart of your audience desires, but they in no way will lend credibility to your arguments, and they don\'t justify calling sicko a documentary, it\'s rather a biopic with moore acting as his own ghostwriter. so, to sum it up, wait until it\'s on tv ( or download it from the net if you must ), just don\'t be part of the hype and buy a ticket for this, buy aspirin instead : ) it doesn\'t even work as a movie this time around either, it\'s not a comedy , it\'s not a satire, it\'s not even good entertainment, with moore\'s other documentaries you could at least turn of your brain, ignore the \\ "" facts \\ "" based side of his cinematic diatribes and just enjoy them as great pieces of fiction and a jukebox approach to modern history and politics. sicko doesn\'t go together with popcorn all that well, it\'s an overlong session of finger pointing with no direction and nowhere to go, no wonder they end up near guantanamo bay towards the end of the movie, and when moore unpacks his bullhorn and tries to communicate with a far off security tower you know you have reached the rump of ludicrous, it\'s so pathetic it almost create an image of moore as a modern day anti don quijote or a fool\'s fool.']"

This has a great cast of actors but the casting is terrible. Some of the scenes are laughable for their over earnest attempt to be period correct. This movie also has a lot of plot point elements that should be interesting but aren't which you can only blame on the directing. Too many elements and too many messages and all told in the most banal way. The costume design and production sets are well done but then why wouldn't they be considering how many films, and series have been made about this time period just in the past few years. I really wanted to like this movie but half way thru I was too bored for words. I also felt like I'd been bludgeoned by victorian era nerds. There's just too many historical messages they're trying to get across both clumsily and 'ham handed'. 1) the story hinges on sympathy for penn's character. Fail. Epic fail. 2) the story hinges on sympathy for mel gibson's character. Fail. The story is cliche. To make it a dramatic piece they of course have to make the main character struggle against great adversities but they never quite make it relatable and clear how difficult it was to make a dictionary, or what real adversities he had to deal with.\nIt could be done but it wasn't in this movie. Similarly they never quite make it relatable and clear how backward psychiatry was in the victorian period. It can be done and it has been done before on film but not in this film. 3) the story hinges on sympathy for natalie dormer's character. Fail. Her performance was wonderful to watch but I wonder if she knew how comical she looked in different scenes with regard to the context of the story. We only see her a few times but we're expected to believe that she makes this great transition in every scene throughout the movie. I know that they're dumbing down films for audiences but this is a bit too far. My advice to everyone behind this production, go back to film school and pay attention this time. I predict that this movie will be a flop and the backers will claim it's a film genre not in favor by the audience today but that's nonsense.

There is killing (by arrows, spears, burning...no gore however).Have you ever wanted to see a movie where the heroes die?  Well, this is it. The Lionheart boys die...twice.

Tingle just happens to have a dragon too...a sorry beast that looks more like a stuffed walrus on fire.This movie is a sorry mess.  The music score is just plain dreadful.

1679,0.0,"I've been following the Ackman/Herbalife story with amusement for years. This was an entertaining movie to watch, if this was a work of fiction I would give it 7/10. But as a documentary, I hold it to a much higher standard...So, this movie would have you believe that Herbalife is the biggest pyramid scheme in the history of the world. A bold claim indeed! Prove it to me, this movie did not. First, Herbalife sells Billions of dollars in product a year, year after year. That is Billions with a capital (B), real product to real people, apparently not worth mentioning by the film maker. Next, the FTC did an extensive audit of Herbalife, and did not shut them down. You would have me believe that the biggest pyramid scheme in the history of the world can pass an FTC audit? Seriously? Sorry, I find the premise ludicrous. Herbalife was given a fine, and worked with he FTC to clean up it's bad practices. I highly recommend reading the FAQ on FTC.gov on this case before watching this movie.This movie strings together a bunch of hard luck stories with the obvious intent to play on the viewer emotions. The film maker would like you to believe that Herbalife is this evil corporation, and is totally at fault. In my opinion, anyone going into any business is responsible for doing their due diligence. The movie does not explore this simple truth in any meaningful way. The film fails to explore the distinction of where the fault lies, which is to some degree with Herbalife, some degree with the dealers doing the recruiting, and some degree with the new recruits. In my opinion the movie has the blame between the three backwards.The real underlying problem, is age old, runs across every business, in every country, over all time. People will rip other people off for money. Commission sales brings out the worst in people, making exaggerated claims to play on emotions in order to make that sale. The only unique thing here is that the biggest sale get a new recruit, this is the normal business model for all multi-level marketing organizations, not unique to Herbalife at all.The only possible redeeming quality of this movie is that you can watch it with your children and teach them not to be a dumb ass. There are two sides to every story, teach your children to look for both, and avoid being manipulated by a one sided story someone else wants to sell you.See that guy that bought 5 nutrition clubs, well the smart thing would have been to buy one and see how it goes, he has nobody to blame but himself. Here is a guy with a construction business, and allows himself to be sold on hype, did he learn nothing in building his business? Why isn't his construction business successful? Maybe he just doesn't the talent to run a business in the first place. This person has a basement and garage full of product they can't sell, maybe they should have sold what they had first before ordering more. Stupid is as stupid does Forrest.Full disclosure: I have never tried a Herbalife product, and probably never will, I'm not a fan of the direct sell business model. I am very much into nutrition and supplementation.

There was an excitement &amp; buzz with the first Twilight movie and its young up- and-coming cast. This was a great story of sacrifice &amp; forbidden love...However, by Eclipse, all the momentum &amp; excitement built in the previous movies was GONE. I mean, as cold &amp; dead as Edward Cullen's heart! The movie tries to carry the complicated, lovey-dovey relationship between Edward &amp; Bella right from the opening scene -- but something is amiss. The lighting is fake, the vampire makeup way too pale &amp; dramatic, and too many of the main characters have completely FAKE &amp; distracting hair pieces (including Kristen Stewart wearing a terrible, oddly colored brown wig!).Bella's character &amp; her dialogue had lost its pessimistic &amp; sarcastic edge. All continuity from the previous movies was gone. I believe Stewart was also filming The Runaways, but ALL the actors were just going through the motions, I felt. They were more concerned with their hair, makeup, clothes &amp; action shots than the edgy &amp; dark story line. The dialogue too, particularly with Jacob, is laugh-out-loud cheesy. No wonder they just keep him on camera shirtless. Taylor Laudner will be lucky to ever land another real \""acting\"" gig again! He's eye candy, and not even that good looking when you actually study his face.I couldn't help but roll my eyes during much of this movie. I felt almost embarrassed for the cast!

1703,0.0,"I have to give Pixar credit for being faithful to their green theme - by applying the concept of recycling and conservation to their own movie. I can think of not one original idea offered in Wall-E - but could trot out a laundry list of earlier movies it has borrowed from, paid homage to...or just plain ripped off. The hero himself is nothing more than an amalgam of ET, Short Circuit, Silent Running and a few other robotic movie characters, and what voice he has is that nasal/adolescent whine that movie makers seem to have en masse declared to embody the essence of innocent or cute. Actually, it's just a nasal/adolescent whine.I'm not going to echo those who bash the movie for its preachy environmental theme. After all, name a kid's movie or animated feature that isn't preachy. That's nothing more or less than I expected. But I will give Pixar a tarnished star for its cynicism. The film's Buy N Large mega-corporation is the villain as it entertains humanity into oblivion, while Pixar itself rakes in billions not only from the movie but from every tie-in, placement, and merchandising deal it can get its hands on...while doing its level best to become the mega-corporation of its cautionary tale and entertain humanity into oblivion.We went to the movie because our ten year old granddaughter is spending a chunk of the summer with us, so we caught it at a drive-in (yes, we still have some - thank heavens!) where it was double billed with Get Smart. All of us enjoyed Get Smart much more than Wall-E. Knowing that our granddaughter was coming, we loaded up on rented kid's movies, most of them animated. We've seen much better than this in the past few weeks. As a matter of fact, just a few days after the drive-in, Robots arrived - and we felt it was far superior to Wall-E. It's preachiness was more direct and more easily absorbed by a ten year old - \""You Can Shine No Matter What you're Made Of\"" - and \""Find a Need and Fill It\"". And it displayed far more imagination, character development and humor than Wall-E. I realize that Pixar took a big gamble in choosing to do much of this movie without dialogue, but there is just so much you can accomplish by repeating \""Wall-E!\"" and \""Eve!\"" with different inflections. In other words, the gamble didn't pay off - at least for the audience.If you're looking for state of the art CGI you probably won't find anything better...yet. But if you're looking for humor there are tons of better choices and if you're looking for something heart-warming you can also do much, much better.

Accepting roles in the visionary adaptation were A-Listers Tom Hanks,  Halle Berry, Susan Sarandon, Hugo Weaving, Hugh Grant, Jim Sturgess and  Keith David. And with a screenplay adapted by Tykwer and the two  Wachowski's, Cloud Atlas rolled in front of the cameras late last year  and now has it's World Premiere at the Toronto International Film  Festival.  Multiple characters, eras and story lines have notary Adam Ewing (Jim  Sturgess \u0096 Above the Universe) keeping a journal on his voyage across  the Pacific Ocean in the 19th Century; A musician in 1931 Belgium who  writes of his experiences in a letter to his love; A journalist (Halle  Berry) who investigates a murder that has taken place at a nuclear  plant circa 1975; A publisher in modern day England and his pursuit by  gangsters; A clone is interviewed on the eve of her execution in  futuristic Korea; and a tribesman (Hanks) in post-apocalyptic Hawaii is  visited by a member of a dead civilization. The stories are intertwined  and jump rapidly between each arch sometimes in as little as just a few  seconds between swaps.  All of the above story lines are weaved together in a 163-minute  adventure drama that desperately tries to become the most audacious and  epic film of the 2012 theatrical release year.  And although we can agree that the term 'epic' is aptly applied, Cloud  Atlas is also a labyrinth mess of a film that will alienate and confuse  audiences more than having them engrossed in story development.  Tom Hanks is clearly the actor of focus embodying over 11 different  characters through the different time zones and stories. With the  exception of one storyline that has Hanks as a British thug who commits  a violent act towards a critic, Hanks' ability and presence keeps the  film afloat while the ship takes water. All other actors play multiple  roles all competently, even Hugo Weaving who in one story plays a Nurse  Ratchet type female caregiver.  All other stories with the exception of one where Jim Broadbent plays  an aging composer are interesting enough even if they don't grab  audiences in a way that would have one root for one specific  character's journey.  The story arc that is rooted in the future where a clone falls in love  with a human adds some punch and high tech effects which help pass the  far too stretched 160+ minute running time.  There are also some scenes of incredible violence in Cloud Atlas.  Throats get cut, people get thrown off buildings and Korean clone women  get strung up like meat cattle. The violence is graphic but it is also  awkward in a movie that doesn't seem to be able to find its true voice.  Cloud Atlas is therefore like a glass of cold, flat Coca-Cola. It does  satisfy an immediate desire for taste and sugar, but it's ultimately  unsatisfying and leaves you wishing you had ordered something else.  We will also predict that Cloud Atlas will not only be shut out of any  Oscar or awards conversations, but the estimated $100 million will be  very tough to recoup even with all that star power headlining the  poster.",['a-listers accepted roles in the visionary adaptation of the film. the film is a labyrinth mess of a film that will alienate and confuse audiences more than having them engrossed in story development.'],"[""they said that it couldn't be filmed. we said that david mitchell's cloud atlas \\ u0096 considered by today a literary masterpiece \\ u0096 with its globe spanning, time - tripping plot shall not be adapted for the big screen due to the complexity that fell between the pages. but that didn't seem to scare of a trio of directors \\ u0096 tom tykwer ( run lola run ), andy wachowski and lana wachowski ( the matrix ) \\ u0096 from signing on in an attempt to bring the literary adventure to the big screen. accepting roles in the visionary adaptation were a - listers tom hanks, halle berry, susan sarandon, hugo weaving, hugh grant, jim sturgess and keith david. and with a screenplay adapted by tykwer and the two wachowski's, cloud atlas arrives in front of the cameras of late last year and now has it's world premiere at the toronto international film festival. multiple characters, eras and story lines have notary adam ewing ( jim sturgess \\ u0096 above the universe ) keeping a journal on his voyage across the pacific ocean in the 19th century ; a musician in 1931 belgium who writes of his experiences in a letter to his love ; a journalist ( halle berry ) who investigates a murder that has taken position at a nuclear plant circa 1975 ; a publisher in modern day england and his pursuit by gangsters ; a clone is interviewed on the eve of her execution in futuristic korea ; and a surgeon ( hanks ) in post - apocalyptic hawaii is abducted by a member of another dead civilization. the stories are intertwined and jump rapidly between each arch swaps. all of the above story lines are weaved together in a 163 - minute adventure drama that desperately tries to become the most audacious and epic film of the 2012 theatrical release year. and although both can agree that the designation'epic'is aptly applied, cloud atlas is also a typical spate of a film that will alienate and confuse audiences more than having them engrossed in story development. tom hanks is clearly the actor of focus embodying over 11 different characters through the different time zones and stories. with the exception of one storyline that has hanks as a british thug who commits a violent act towards a critic, hanks'ability and presence keeps the film afloat while the ship takes water. all other actors play multiple roles all competently, even hugo weaving who in one story plays a nurse ratchet type female caregiver. all other stories with the exception of one where jim broadbent plays an aging composer are interesting enough even if they get into't grab audience in a way that would have one root for one specific character's journey. the story arc that is rooted in the future where a clone falls in love with a human adds some punch and high tech effects which help pass the far too stretched 160 + minute running time. there are also some scenes of incredible violence in cloud atlas. throats get cut, people get thrown off buildings and korean clone women get strung up like meat cattle. the violence is graphic but information technology is also awkward in a moving picture show that doesn't seem to be able to find its true voice. cloud atlas is therefore like a glass of cold, flat coca - cola. it does satisfy an immediate desire for taste and sugar, but it's ultimately unsatisfying and leaves you wishing you had ordered something else. we will also predict that cloud atlas will not only be shut out of any oscar or awards conversations, but the estimated $ 100 million will be very tough to recoup even with all that star power headlining the poster.""]"

1740,0.0,"No doubt about it. This movie stinks. There was no reason to use the Catholic Church to express the theme of this drama, but the liberal Illuminati that run the movie industry have yet to miss a chance to bash Catholics or Mormons. Until they reduce American to a spiritually dead place--like Europe--they won't stop. Happily,I didn't pay to see this movie. It stinks for a lot of reasons.1. Merle over plays Sister Alyosius to the point of creating a cardboard stereotype. She does her usual accent stick which is becoming a bit boring and adds nothing to her character.2. There is a deliberate and obvious attempt to make her character a villain.3. The writers go overboard in creating a contrast between the sister and the priest. An example is when the two groups are having dinner. The nuns are eating in total silence and the priests are enjoying a raucous meal. Nuns with moral standard=bad priests=rule benders and friends to minority students (i.e. bleeding heart liberals) good.4. The dumbest part of the movie is the end. After getting the father transferred, Sister Alyosius blurts out she never was sure of her accusations. Oh, come on! The whole plot depends on her being an absolutist versus father who practices moral equivalence. Hence the movie comes apart in the final scene.5. It's not clear why Father Flynn doesn't fight back against the child molesting charges. Is he really guilty? The viewer is not left with any clear clues so it's perplexing to say the least.6. The relationship between the principal and the nun who teaches there is bogus. As her superior, Sister Alyosius would not have been so chummy with Sister James. No garden tete-a-tetes or stunning confessions would have happened between them due to their difference in status.7. And as a bow to the gays the black student may be homosexual.

1741,0.0,"Disney paid over $4 billion to buy Lucasfilm, George Lucas himself served as creative consultant, I was super excited about a new movie, and the original stars returning, it was just a question of whether the acquisition was worth it, forget the prequels (no Jar Jar Binks), directed by J. J. Abrams (Lost, Mission: Impossible III, Star Trek, Super 8). Basically, it's been 30 years since the destruction of the second Death Star, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), the last Jedi, has disappeared, the remains of the fallen Galactic Empire have risen and become The First Order, seeking to eliminate Skywalker and the Republic, the Resistance, backed by the Republic, are led by Luke's sister, Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), opposing the First Order and searching for Luke. On the planet Jakku, Resistance pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) obtains a map to Luke's location from village elder Lor San Tekka (Max von Sydow), Stormtroopers, commanded by Kylo Ren (What If's Adam Driver), destroy the village and capture Poe, his droid BB-8 escapes with the map, and comes across scavenger Rey (introducing Daisy Ridley) at a junkyard settlement. The First Order Stormtrooper FN-2187 (Attack the Block's John Boyega) is unable to kill, gets away, frees Poe and they escape in a stolen TIE fighter, Poe gives him the new name \""Finn\"". Poe and Finn crash on Jakku, Finn appears to be the only survivor, he finds Rey and BB-8 in the village, the First Order find them and attack, the three flee the planet in the stolen, rundown Millennium Falcon. Following a chase and escape, the Falcon breaks down and is captured by a larger ship, piloted by Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew and Joonas Suotamo), they reclaim their former ship, finding Rey and Finn, Han explains that Luke tried to rebuild the Jedi Order, but a student turned to the Dark Side, Luke went into exile and all he built was destroyed. The five escape on the Falcon when attacked by criminal gangs, the gangs inform the First Order of Han's involvement, the Falcon lands on the planet Takodana, the group meet cantina owner Maz Kanata (12 Years a Slave's Lupita Nyong'o), who can help BB-8 reach the Resistance, Rey finds Luke Skywalker's lightsaber, it also belonged to his father Anakin. The First Order have converted a planet into a superweapon capable of destroying star systems, Starkiller Base, Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) orders General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) to use the weapon for the first time to destroy the Republic capital and its fleet, Snoke tells Ren he must kill his father, Han Solo. Takodana is attacked by the First Order, Finn uses the lightsaber in a fight, Resistance X-wing fighters save Finn, Han and Chewbacca, they are led by Poe, but Rey is captured and taken to Starkiller Base, she resists Ren's interrogation and mind-reading, and Rey discovers her powers of the Force, using a Jedi mind trick to escape her cell. Han, Chewbacca, Finn and BB-8 meet Leia at the Resistance base on D'Qar, droid C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) explains that R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) has been inactive since Luke's disappearance, the group learn that BB- 8's map to Luke's location is incomplete. The Resistance plan to lower the planetary shield of Starkiller Base, before it will fire on D'Qar, so the fighters can attack, Leia asks Han to bring their son back alive; Han, Chewbacca and Finn infiltrate the base in the Falcon, the shield is lowered and Rey is found, and explosives are set. They encounter Ren, Han confronts him, using his birth name Ben, and implores him to turn from the Dark Side, but Ren kills his father Han, Chewbacca shoots Ren and sets off the explosives, the Resistance X-wing fighters therefore attack the weapon and the Starkiller Base is destroyed in a chain reaction. Injured Ren chases Finn and Rey to the surface, Finn is injured in a fight using the lightsaber, Rey takes it and overpowers Ren, who is wounded, they are finally separated by the ground crumbling, Snoke orders General Hux to evacuate and bring Ren to him, while Rey, Chewbacca and Finn escape in the Falcon. The Resistance celebrate victory on On D'Qar, but Leia, Chewbacca and Rey mourn Han's death, R2-D2 awakens and reveals the rest of the map, Rey follows this to an island on a distant planet, and there she finds Luke Skywalker, offering him his lightsaber.

Ford, Fisher and Hamill returning makes the nostalgia all the more fun, newcomers Ridley and Boyega are fantastic talents, and Driver a great choice for villain, supporting cast members do great as well.

1746,0.0,"The film reminds me of The Girl Who Leapt Through Time. It's also a teenage, slice of life, romance with supernatural/sci-fi elements. In Your Name, a teenage boy and girl begin mysteriously swapping bodies at random. They end up using this power to help each other, leaving messages on each other's bodies Memento style to communicate. The girl has confidence issues but the guy finds it easy to be confident in her body. The boy can't talk to girls (well one girl) but the girl finds this easy in his body. It's an interesting idea that gets dropped 30 minutes in for a weirdly disconnected plot.The art design was an issue for me. The film opens with a TV anime style opening, with a bland J-pop song and visuals straight out of any generic Naruto or Bleach OP. It's people running and reaching out for stars with eyes that do that little wobble thing. The character designs are too generic. They're almost devoid of personality- made to be purely attractive. Even the backgrounds are distractingly garish. While often detailed, they sap the atmosphere from scenes as they just try to look pretty at odds with the usually dramatic tone.The characterisation is just as bland. The boy puts his hand behind his head and closes his eyes while he talks to girls and- well that's it as far as his personality goes. I don't know what motivates him for most of the film, his likes, or his dislikes. He works at a restaurant and that's about it. I don't even remember his name. The girl has breasts (which the movie likes to highlight) and she's also a bit nervous. It's weird trying to talk about these characters when they don't have any defining traits, they just do things. They say anime stuff like baka and oneechan and all that Jazz. Tropes just feel shoved into the characters in place of a personality. It's especially jarring when I've heard the director compared to Hosoda and Miyazaki, directors known for strong characters.Instead Your Name tries to be more plot focused. To properly explain my feelings, I have to go into spoilers. The body swapping mechanic, as I mentioned earlier, mostly just happens in the first 30 minutes of the film. This accomplishes some small improvements in each character's lives even though their personalities are still one- dimensional. Suddenly, the girl dies in an unforeseen meteor crash. We see this happen but the next 20 minutes of the movie are the boy figuring this out. This is despite the fact that he knew the meteor crash was going to happen and it's frustrating that it takes him so long. Nothing happens in these 20 minutes to establish any personality or connection with any characters. It felt like wasted time and I was confused why they abandoned their most interesting plot device. The boy then realises, because of blatant foreshadowing earlier in the film, that he can time travel to tell the girl about the meteor and he does that. Then she tries to get people out of her town but it doesn't work. But then we find out that it did work. We're also told that the boy and the girl are in love. A few other things happen, then it ends.Although I love the animation process I'm not interested in watching most anime. It's not that most of them are generic, that's the case with every type of media from Hollywood films to video games. It's the pornographic power fantasy aspect in so many of them that makes them feel immature and amateurish. Once again, in Your Name a personality-less guy and a personality-less girl with bouncy boobs get together. There's no humanity in this. It's just vacuous but pretty plot events happening in a row. Not that I don't like movies that are about spectacle but this is a drama- I should at least have a reason to care about the main characters.The movie did nothing to make me care about them. In a 2-minute montage to another bad J-pop song they mention that the boy and girl invented an elaborate system to communicate with each other while body swapping. That sounded cool and I wish we'd seen them developing this instead of just telling us it happened. It's literal telling instead of showing. The bigger issue is that these small scenes are the only time these characters go through any development. These minor issues facing the boy and girl are solved less than halfway through the movie. The movie then just invents unconnected problems, solutions, and plot points to fill the other hour of its run time. The climax, where the girl warns the townspeople about the comet, was more engaging. The animation's good and it was more exciting. But the flat characters and direction held it back far too much.I'll compare it to Hosoda's The Girl Who Leapt Through Time which is similar in terms of plot, but far better (Spoiler alert for the movie). In TGWLTT (at least Your Name has a shorter title) the movie constantly hints at a romance between the main character and one of her friends. It's presented as comedic so we don't take it seriously though. The girl's personality is established early on and we see that she's generally nice but unlike her peers she just wants to mess around and doesn't take life seriously. This is relatable and it's fun to watch her play around with time. This makes the reveal that the romance was serious and that her time travelling destroyed their chance for a relationship tragic and engaging. There's nothing this emotionally engaging in Your Name. Things just happen that are not set up or paid off well at all. There wasn't anything or anyone I could relate to. It's straight up bad film making.Rated 1 star to lower the ridiculously high rating.","[""the film reminds me of the girl who leapt through time. it's also a teenage, slice of life, romance with supernatural/sci-fi elements.""]","[""the film reminding me of the girl who leapt through time. it's also a teenage, slice of life, romance with supernatural / sci -

Well I watched this on video and was stunned' take a historical disaster and turn it into a romance novel' lol james Cameron has arrived. Its a real shame because I really liked the terminator' but that was when he was broke and visual effects were in its infancy the irony is the more money he makes the worse the movie and its not like this was a one off' it spawned other historical disasters like pearl harbour which was a titanic rip off.
